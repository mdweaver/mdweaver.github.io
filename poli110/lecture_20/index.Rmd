# Correlation to Causation

## Solutions to Confounding

1. Conditioning:

- What is it
- How does it work?
- Assumptions


# Recap

## Solutions to Confounding

We want to use **correlation** to provide evidence of **causation**:

- but we know that confounding (a form of **bias**) can lead us astray.
- if we can reasonably *make some assumptions*, correlation can be *strong evidence of causality* without bias.

>- What **are** the assumptions needed to infer correlation $\to$ causation?
>- How can we check/interrogate those assumptions?

## Internal vs External Validity

**Every way** of using correlation as evidence for causality makes trade-off between:

- **internal validity**: how plausible are assumptions that set aside confounding?
- **external validity**: how much does this causal relationship speak to the causal claim/question of interest?

---

| Solution | How Bias<br>Solved | Which Bias<br>Removed | Assumes | Internal<br>Validity | External<br>Validity |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Experiment | Randomization<br>Breaks $W \rightarrow X$ link | **All** confounding variables | $X$ is random<br> Change only $X$ | High | Low | 
| Conditioning | Hold confounders<br>constant | ? | ? | Low | High |

# Conditioning

## Conditioning

### **conditioning**

when we observe $X$ and $Y$ for multiple cases, we examine the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ *within* groups of cases that are **the same** on confounding variables $W, etc. \ldots$

How does conditioning solve the problem? 

- Cases compared have **same values** on confounding variable(s) $W$
- In these groups, $W$ cannot affect $X$ or $Y$ (because $W$ is not moving, it can't move $X$ or $Y$)
- "Backdoor path" from $X$ to $Y$ is "blocked"

# How does it work?

## Example: Conditioning

[Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf) compare hate crimes in counties with and without Trump rallies, but condition on (hold constant):

- percent Jewish
- number of hate groups
- crime rate
- 2012 Republican vote share
- percent university educated
- region

## Example: Conditioning

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
dagify(hate_crime ~ rally + jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region,
      rally ~ jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region,
       exposure = "rally", 
       outcome = 'hate_crime',
       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",
                  'jewish' = '% Jewish',
                  'hate_group' = '# Hate\nGroups',
                  "crime" = "Crime\nRate",
                  'gop' = 'GOP\nVoters',
                  'univ'= 'Univ.\nEducated',
                  'region' = "Region"
                  )) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link(mapping = aes(label = c(rep("held constant", 9), "", rep("held constant", 4)), label_size = 2),
                      angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(rep(1,14),'lines'),
                      edge_linetype = rep(c(3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3), each = 100),
                      arrow = grid::arrow(length=grid::unit(c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,0), 'pt'), type = 'closed')) + 
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
```

## Example: Conditioning

| County | HC(Yes) <br> Y | HC(No) <br> Y | Rally (X) | Jewish<br>% | Hate<br>Groups | Crime<br>Rate | Rep.<br>% | Univ.<br> % | Region |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| a      | $More$    | $\color{red}{Fewer}$  | Yes   | 2        | 3           | 15         | 53     | 38      | South  |
|        |     $\Downarrow$    |    $\Uparrow$    |       |          |             |            |        |         |        |
| b      | $\color{red}{More}$    | $Fewer$   | No    | 2        | 3           | 15         | 53     | 38      | South  

## Example: Conditioning

[Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf) find that, even after conditioning, Trump rallies increase the risk of hate crimes by 200%!

- Lots of news headlines [like this](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/24/18279807/trump-hate-crimes-study-white-nationalism)


## Example: Conditioning

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}

rally_data = fread('./trump_rally_data.csv')


data = rally_data %>% 
        .[, list(rally = clintoneverrally[1], 
                 hate_crimes = ifelse(clintoneverrally[1] == 1,
                                      sum(incidentcount[clintonrallyoccured ==1]) / sum(clintonrallyoccured),
                                      sum(incidentcount)/length(incidentcount)
                                      )
                 ), by = fips]

ggplot(data, aes(x = rally, y = hate_crimes)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.1) +  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + 
  xlab("Clinton Rallies (Any)") +
  ylab("Hate Crimes (per Month)") +
  ggtitle("Clinton Rallies and Hate Crimes by County (2016):\nCorrelation") + 
  theme_bw()
```

## Example: Conditioning

[Economics PhD Candidates](https://github.com/lilleymatthew/Trump_Rallies_Replication_Materials/blob/master/Trump_Rallies_and_Hate_Crimes.pdf) show that **conditioning on the same variables**...

- **Clinton rallies** increased hate crimes by **nearly 250%!!**

We would be wrong to use observed hate crimes in county $b$ (without a rally) to substitute in for counterfactual hate crimes in county $a$ (without a rally). 

Population differences $\to$ difference in hate crimes regardless of rally.

## Example: Conditioning

After also conditioning on population (a confounder): no correlation.

# Assumptions

## Conditioning Assumptions

In order to use conditioning to infer $X$ causes $Y$ if $X,Y$ correlated ...

### **Must Assume**

1. There are **no other confounding variables** (that you have not conditioned on)
    - i.e. you have conditioned on ALL confounding variables
    - sometimes called "ignorability assumption": you assume you can "ignore" other variables without confounding

**How can we tell whether this assumption is correct?**

DISCUSS

## Conditioning Assumptions

1. Assume there are **no other confounding variables** (that you have not conditioned on)

- this can never be proven to be true: a "strong" assumption
- we can't know whether all confounders are blocked because we don't know true causal graph
- compare this against the assumption of randomization in experiments

## Example

In wake of mass shootings, we might ask:

**Do mass shooting events cause people to become more supportive of stricter gun control policies?**

## Example

<img src='https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/nowaytoprevent10022017twitter.jpg?w=1280' width=80%>

## Example

[Newman and Hartman (2017)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/mass-shootings-and-public-support-for-gun-control/8F38356AF4DB22B8B7DF28052234FA09) examine whether exposure to mass shootings cause an increase in support for stricter gun control

- Use large political attitudes survey (CCES) to look at individual responses to: "In general, do you feel that laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, less strict, or kept as they are?"
- Measure exposure to mass shooting as "distance to nearest mass shooting in recent years"

>- **What might be possible confounding variables?**

## Example

```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
dagify(gun_control ~ shooting + policy + crime + movie,
       shooting ~ crime + mental + policy,
       exposure = "shooting", 
       outcome = 'gun_control',
       labels = c('shooting' = "(X)Mass\nShooting", 
                  'gun_control' = "(Y) Gun\nAttitudes",
                  'mental' = 'Mental\nHealthcare',
                  "crime" = "Crime",
                  'policy' = 'Gun\nLaws',
                  'movie' = "Loves\nJohn Wick")) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link() +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
```

Which variables do we NEED to condition on? Which variables do we NOT NEED to condition on?

## Assumptions

**Must Assume**

1. There are **no other confounding variables** (that you have not conditioned on)

  - i.e. you have conditioned on ALL confounding variables
  - this can never be proven to be true: a "strong" assumption
    
But...  

  - don't need to condition on **ALL** variables that might affect $X$ or affect $Y$: only confounders.


## Example

```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
dagify(gun_control ~ shooting + med_2 + crime ,
       shooting ~ crime  + med_1,
       med_1 ~ policy,
       med_2 ~ policy,
       exposure = "shooting", 
       outcome = 'gun_control',
       labels = c('shooting' = "(X)Mass\nShooting", 
                  'gun_control' = "(Y) Gun\nAttitudes",
                  'med_1' = 'Gun Access',
                  "crime" = "Crime",
                  'policy' = 'Gun\nLaws',
                  'med_2' = "Move to\nGun State")) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +

  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +

```

Which variables do we NEED to condition on? Which variables do we NOT NEED to condition on?

## Assumptions

**Must Assume**

1. There are **no other confounding variables** (that you have not conditioned on)

  - i.e. you have conditioned on ALL confounding variables
  - this can never be proven to be true: a "strong" assumption
    
But...  

  - don't need to condition on **ALL** variables that might affect $X$ or affect $Y$: only confounders.
  - don't need to condition on **ALL** variables on a backdoor path. Just one variable per backdoor path is needed.

## Example

[Newman and Hartman (2017)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/mass-shootings-and-public-support-for-gun-control/8F38356AF4DB22B8B7DF28052234FA09):

Compare proximity to mass shooting and gun control attitudes, conditioning on (holding constant:

- community level factors: income, education, partisanship, racial composition, murder, firearms stores, population density, population
- individual level factors: education, income, age, gender, race, property ownership, having children, in military, military family, partisanship, ideology, religiosity, region of birth

>- Are there any potentially **really important** confounders that might not be included?

Proximity to mass shootings increases support for stricter gun laws... **assuming no other confounders**

## Assumptions

**Must Assume**

1. There are **no other confounding variables** (that you have not conditioned on)

But...  

  - don't need to condition on **ALL** variables that might affect $X$ or affect $Y$: only confounders.
  - don't need to condition on **ALL** variables on a backdoor path. Just one variable per backdoor path is needed.
  - we **can** give reasons/arguments for why we think any remaining confounding is likely small OR biased against the correlation (*small* bias may not be enough to change our conclusions, or bias is **against** our conclusions)


## Conditioning Assumptions

In order to infer $X$ causes $Y$ if $X,Y$ correlated after conditioning

### **Must Assume**

<ol start=2>
  <li> 
  **Variables used to condition** relationship between $X$ and $Y$ are **measured without error**.</li>
</ol>

- even **random measurement error** in confounding variables leads conditioning to not remove bias.
- Why? You are no longer comparing like-with-like.

## Conditioning Assumptions

Imagine we want to condition on gun ownership, when examining correlation of mass shootings and gun attitudes.

What if we measure **gun ownership** with random measurement error?

Let's see what happens... BOARD


## Conditioning Assumptions

In order to infer $X$ causes $Y$ if $X,Y$ correlated after conditioning

### **Must Assume**

<ol start=3>
  <li> 
  We can **find** cases that are **the same** on confounding variables $W$ and different in $X$.</li>
</ol>

## Example:

Let's say we want to examine the effect of gun laws on gun violence across countries:

What are some factors that might affect strictness of gun regulation and gun violence?

---


```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
dagify(gun_control ~ unemployment + inequality + welfare + capacity + slavery + settler  ,
       shooting ~ gun_control + unemployment + inequality + welfare + capacity + slavery + settler ,
       exposure = "gun_control", 
       outcome = 'shooting',
       labels = c('shooting' = "(Y)Gun\nViolence", 
                  'gun_control' = "(X) Gun\nRestrictions",
                  'unemployment' = 'Unemployment',
                  "inequality" = "Inequality",
                  'welfare' = 'Welfare\nSpending',
                  'capacity' = "State\nCapacity",
                  'slavery' = 'Slavery\nLegacy',
                  'settler' = 'Settler\nColonial')) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link() +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
```

Is there, e.g., country that is similar to the US on all confounders?

## Conditioning: Limitations

In order to infer $X$ causes $Y$ if $X,Y$ correlated after conditioning

### **Must Assume**

<ol start=3>
  <li> 
  There are cases that are **the same** on confounding variables $W$ and different in $X$.</li>
</ol>

- as we want to condition on more and more variables...
- less and less likely we find cases that exactly match
- so, cannot condition on all confounding variables

# Conclusion

---

| Solution | How Bias<br>Solved | Which Bias<br>Removed | Assumes | Internal<br>Validity | External<br>Validity |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Experiment | Randomization<br>Breaks $W \rightarrow X$ link | **All** confounding variables | $X$ is random<br> Change only $X$ | High | Low | 
| Conditioning | Hold confounders<br>constant | Only variables <br> conditioned on | Condition on all confounders; <br> Low measurement error; <br> Have similar cases | Low | High |

## Conclusion

**Conditioning**:

- examine correlation of $X$ and $Y$ for cases that are the same on confounders $W$
- Assumptions:
  - no other confounding variables: can't check
  - no measurement error: can check
  - similar cases with different $X$: can check
- While imperfect, we should not dismiss this approach.


## Limits of Conditioning:

### **Did Trump rallies *increase* hate crimes?**

1. If we know confounding variables, can we find cases *with* and *without* rallies that are **the same on *many* confounding variables**?

2. If we don't know or can't measure confounding variables, may **still be differences** between places with and without rallies that produce confounding.


>- Is there a **better comparison** we can make that permits us **hold (potentially unmeasurable) confounders constant** and where we can **easily find a "similar" case** that didn't have a rally?

# Before and After

## Before and After

We can make Before and After comparisons:

- we compare the **same case** before and after it experiences some cause

## Example: Before and After

Taking the same data from [Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf)...

- we focus **only** on counties that **ever had** a Trump (Clinton) rally
- compare the month **after** the rally to the month **before** the rally


```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
rally_data = fread('./trump_rally_data.csv')

#trump rallies
trump_rally = rally_data[trumpeverrally %in% 1]

trump_rally[, t_window := month_num - min(month_num[trumprallyoccured > 0]), by = fips]
trump_rally[, hc_per_capita := incidentcount/exp(log_pop)*100000]
trump_rally[, hc_per_capita_alt := hate_crimes/exp(log_pop)*100000]

trump_rally[, t_window_f := factor(t_window, levels = c(0, -4:-1, 1:4))]
trump_rally[, min_window := min(t_window), by = fips]
trump_rally[, max_window := max(t_window), by = fips]

#clinton rallies
clinton_rally = rally_data[clintoneverrally %in% 1]

## Before and After

DISCUSS 

If we compare counties to themselves **before** and **after** rallies... 


1. Which confounding variables are held constant?

2. What are confounding variables that might NOT be addressed in this comparison?

## Design Based Solutions

**Conditioning** removes confounding by:

- identifying possible confounding variables
- measuring confounding variables
- relationship b/t $X$ and $Y$ for cases with **similar value** of confounding variables $W$.


## Design Based Solutions

**Design-based** solutions remove confounding by:

- selecting cases for comparison in order to eliminate **many** known/unknown as well as measurable/unmeasurable confounding variables.
- the nature of the comparison holds constant **classes of confounding variables**, not  **specific** confounding variables.
- by a "class" we mean all confounding variables that share certain properties


## Example: Before and After

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
dagify(hate_crime ~ rally + jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region + pop,
      rally ~ jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region + pop,
       exposure = "rally", 
       outcome = 'hate_crime',
       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",
                  'jewish' = '% Jewish',
                  'hate_group' = 'Racism',
                  "crime" = "Crime Rate",
                  'gop' = 'Republican\nVoters',
                  'univ'= 'Univ.\nEducated',
                  'region' = "Region",
                  'pop' = 'Population'
                  )) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link(mapping = aes(label = c(rep('',11), "?" ,rep('', 4))),
                      angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(rep(1,15),'lines')) +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
```

Which of these possible confounders are held constant in a before-and-after comparison?

## Example: Before and After

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}

      rally ~ unchanging + changing,

       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",
                  'changing' = 'Changing\nAttributes',
                  'unchanging' = 'Unchanging\nAttributes'
                  )) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link() +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()

## Example: Before and After

### **Confounding Solved?**...

**All** confounding variables (affect whether a rally occurs; affect hate crimes) that are **unchanging over time** (before to) are held constant.

- because held constant, cannot produce confounding
- e.g., demographic features, political leaning, location/geography, long-term economic trends, 8chan white nationalists
- any variable that does not change **in the time period of the comparison** (in this case, two months) held constant
- does not matter if we can think of or even measure the confounders
