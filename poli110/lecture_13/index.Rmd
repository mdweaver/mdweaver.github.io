# Causal Claims

## Today

### **1. Introduction to Causality**

- **What is causality?**
- **Counterfactuals**
- **Potential Outcomes**


# A Problem in Politics

# Why Causality?

## Why descriptive claims matter:

**descriptive claims** appear in **diagnostic** settings:

- people attempt to convince you that there is a "problem" in need of fixing.

"Political polarization has gotten worse over time in the US"

## Why causality?

When people give justifications to act or think a particular way:

**causal claims** appear in support of **prescriptive claims**: claims about **consequences of actions**

Typically speaks to:

- **what caused the problem** that needs to be fixed?
- **what action** will produce the **solution**/**better outcome**?


## Causal claims answer causal questions

<h3><ol>
<li> What are the **causes** of **effects**?
</ol></h3>

Want to explain something specific that has happened/we observe (**the effect**). Seek to **attribute** a cause for something we observe. "There is a problem. How did we get here?"

- Why did Russia invade Ukraine?
- Why is housing expensive in Vancouver?
- **Why has political polarization increased?**d

## Causal claims answer causal questions

<h3><ol start=2>
<li> What are the **effects** of **causes**?
</ol></h3>

We want to know what happens if we do some action or some action (**the cause**) happens. This is about the **consequences** of some action. "If we take this action, will it solve the problem?"

- Has BC's housing speculation tax reduced housing prices? 
- What are the effects of restricting gun ownership on gun violence?
- **Does abstaining from social media reduce political polarization?**

## Two ways of asking causal questions

### Looking at **effects of causes** versus **causes of effects**  leads to different approaches to scientific investigation

**causes of effects**
$$\textrm{?} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{effect}$$

**effects of causes**
$$\textrm{cause} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{?}$$

Effects of causes? Causes of effects?



## Why Causality?

Causal claims linked to reasons given for **what we should do**


### **We need to know:**

- what do we mean by causality?
- what kind of causal claims are we talking about? (effects of causes, causes of effects)
- when and why can we see "evidence" for causality, when in fact there is none? (failure of *weak severity*)
- what tools can we use to test causal claims with *strong severity*? (we know and can check assumptions)



# What is causality?

## What is causality?

### all **causal claims** are a combination of (at least) two specific descriptive claims

<br>

- sometimes these descriptive claims are made **explicit**, typically they are **implied**.
- means that: any possible issues we saw with evidence for descriptive claims can occur with causal claims

## What is causality?

> **Homelessness increased in Canadian cities because of a Federal government headed by Justin Trudeau.**

- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

> **And we're also straightening out our cities. You know, Washington D.C., our beautiful capital, was a, a killing mess. People getting killed all the time. It was very high crime. And we sent in our National Guard ... And now it's a very safe, now it's considered a very safe. The crime is down to almost nothing.** - Donald Trump

>- What is the main causal claim?
>- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

The **descriptive claims** embedded in **causal claims** are of a specific type:

1. One is a claim about how the world *actually* is (**factual**)
2. One is a claim about how the world *would* be, if something were changed (**counterfactual**)

### **counterfactuals** are the key to causality

> **And we're also straightening out our cities. You know, Washington D.C., our beautiful capital, was a, a killing mess. People getting killed all the time. It was very high crime. And we sent in our National Guard ... And now it's a very safe, now it's considered a very safe. The crime is down to almost nothing.** - Donald Trump

# Counterfactuals

## Causality is Counterfactual

### **What does that mean?**

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactuals**: are the way world **would be** if events had transpired differently (other than what actually took place).

- imagine an "alternate universe" or "alternate timeline"

contrasts to what is **factual**: the way the world is, given the events that have taken place.

# Spoiler Warning!

## Counterfactuals:

If Gwyneth Paltrow's character...

(a) **catches the train** then she catches her boyfriend cheating, and **dumps him**

(b) **does not catch the train** then she does not catch her boyfriend cheating, and **stays with him**

In reality, only **one** of these possibilities can happen. If (a) happens, it is **factual**, (b) is **counterfactual**

## An exercise 

**"Exposure to social media increases political polarization."**

In the lead-up to the 2025 Canadian Election,  platforms owned by Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) blocked users access to content from Canadian news organizations while simultaneously ending fact-checking ([source](https://dfrlab.org/2025/04/29/how-social-media-shaped-the-2025-canadian-election/)). This "enabled hyper-partisan content to dominate in the absence of balanced media coverage."

"**causal variable**": exposure to social media during the election

**outcome variable**: political polarization $\to$ willingness to go on a date with someone who supports an opposing political party.

## An exercise 

**"Exposure to social media increases political polarization."**

### Think and write...


Imagine: If you used social media during the election, would you be willing to go on a date with someone who supported a rival political party?

Imagine: If you did not use social media during the election, would you go on a date with someone who supported a rival political party?

Take this survey
</div>

## An exercise

**Which of these is factual? Which is counterfactual**?

$1.$ If you used social media during the election, would you go on a date with someone voting for a rival political party?

$2.$ If you did not social media during the election, would you go on a date with someone voting for a rival political party?

>- **It depends**: If you actually used social media, then $1$ is **factual** ($2$ is **counterfactual**); If you didn't actually use social media, then $2$ is **factual** ($1$ is **counterfactual**)

## Potential Outcomes

Counterfactuals can be described with **potential outcomes**:

If $X$ is a **variable** for a suspected cause (using social media) and $Y$ is a **variable** for what is possibly affected (dating rival partisan)... 

then **potential outcomes** are the values of $Y$ that a **specific case** ($i$) would take for the different possible values of $X$ (factual and counterfactual):

- If **you** used social media during the election, would **you** go on this date?
- If **you** did not use  social media during the election, would **you** go on this date?

---

**potential outcomes notation:**

Where $i$ corresponds to a specific case (e.g., **you**, Gwyneth Paltrow)

$\text{Use Social Media}$ ($X$) is the causal variable (and can take different values, e.g. $yes, no$), then the potential outcomes of $\text{Date across party lines}$ ($Y_i$) are:

$$\text{Date across party lines}_{i}(\text{Social media} = yes),\\ \text{Date across party lines}_i(\text{Social Media} = no)$$

For person $i$, $\text{Social Media}$ can only ever be $yes$ or $no$: one potential outcome is **factual** (it will happen), while the other will remain $\color{red}{\textbf{counterfactual}}$ (it won't happen)

$^*$ Note, I will use $\color{red}{red}$ to indicate counterfactual potential outcomes 

## Potential Outcomes

$\mathrm{Love \ Life _{Gwyneth} (Catches \ the \ train )}$
$= \mathrm{Dump \ cheating \ BF}$

$\mathrm{Love \ Life _{Gwyneth} (Doesn't \ catch \ the \ train )}$
$= \mathrm{Stay \ with \ cheating \ BF}$


We only will observe **one** of these two possibilities. But both could **potentially** have happened.


## Potential Outcomes

For any supposed *causal* variable $X$, and *affected* variable $Y$, and case $i$,  we denote potential outcomes as:

$$Y_i(X = ?)$$
What would the **outcome** $Y$ for person/case $i$ have been if $X$ took on some value $?$

---

**Draw potential outcomes on the board**


## Potential Outcomes: Caveat

In our example:

- We are only **imagining**, as if omniscient, what you would do in the alternate universe where you **did**(**did not**) consume political information on social media
- Potential outcomes are what **you actually would do** in that alternate universe.

Even if we **don't know** whether you'd go on a date with a supporter of a rival party if you **did**(**did not**) use social media, we can imagine that there is potential outcome of *what you would have done*...

---

### **What do counterfactuals have to do with causality????**

## Causal Claims

Recall that causal claims are about how some shifting some factor **changes** something outcome...

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactual causality**

We can say that $Y$ changes *because of* $X$ only if, for case $i$,  $Y_i(X = 1) \neq Y_i(X = 0)$:

- $X$ causes $Y$ if case $i$ would have behaved ($Y$) differently (than it did factually) in the (**counterfactual**) alternate universe where **everything was the same** except $X$ was changed.

### Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Trump's causal claim (implicitly): "National Guard deployment reduced murders in Washington, DC."

Trump's counterfactual claim: "If there had been no National Guard, DC would have had more murders."

### Counterfactual claim implies two **potential outcomes**:

1. Number of murders in DC in the past 2 months in the **presence** of the National Guard: $\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard})$
2. Number of murders in DC in the past 2 months in the **absence** of the  National Guard $\color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})}$


---

### Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

If Trump's causal claim is **true** ("National Guard deployment reduced murders in Washington, DC."), which should be true?

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard})  < \color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})} \tag{1}$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard}) > \color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})} \tag{2}$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard}) = \color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})} \tag{3}$$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

> **And we're also straightening out our cities. You know, Washington D.C., our beautiful capital, was a, a killing mess. People getting killed all the time. It was very high crime. And we sent in our National Guard ... And now it's a very safe, now it's considered a very safe. The crime is down to almost nothing.** - Donald Trump

Implies:

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard})  < \color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})}$$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

If the claim is that "National Guard deployment reduced murders in Washington, DC.", or

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{Nat'l Guard})  < \color{red}{\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{DC}}(\textrm{No Nat'l Guard})}$$

 **What kinds of evidence would help assess whether this claim is true?**

## Conclusion:

Causality is **counterfactual**

- this is not a simple, intuitive way of thinking
- this complicates providing evidence

We will see:

- problems: what can go wrong with evidence for causal claims
- tools: possible solutions for these problems
- severity: what must we assume for these tools to work?
