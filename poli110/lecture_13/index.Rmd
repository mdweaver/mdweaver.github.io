## Objectives

### **1. Introduction to Causality**

- **What is causality?**
- **Counterfactuals**
- **Potential Outcomes**


# Causality

## Why causality?

**Recall** some of Weber's insights:

### 1. **science is about prediction**

### 2. **science cannot tell us what to do**, but it can provide **clarity**

- For us, **clarity** means knowing what actions achieve our goals, which do not, and how certain actions might put our values into conflict.

## Why causality?

**In other terms**:

### Science can only help answer **prescriptive questions** by evaluating **causal claims**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

### Without evidence for **causal claims**, we can't make rational decisions about **prescriptive claims**

## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol>
<li> What are the **causes** of **effects**?
</ol></h3>

Want to explain something specific that has happened/we observe (**the effect**). Seek to **attribute** a cause for something we observe. 

- Why did Russia invade Ukraine?
- Why are housing prices very high in Vancouver?

## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol start=2>
<li> What are the **effects** of **causes**?
</ol></h3>

We want to know what happens if we do some action or some action (**the cause**) happens. (Could be a specific action or not) This is about the **contribution** of some cause to an effect.

- Has BC's housing speculation tax reduced housing prices? 
- What are the effects of restricting gun ownership on gun violence?

## Two ways of asking causal questions

### Looking at **effects of causes** versus **causes of effects**  leads to different approaches to scientific investigation

**causes of effects**
$$\textrm{?} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{effect}$$

**effects of causes**
$$\textrm{cause} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{?}$$

# What is causality?

## What is causality?

### all **causal claims** are a combination of two specific descriptive claims

<br>

- sometimes these descriptive claims are made **explicit**, often they are **implied**.

## What is causality?

Why does the US have the highest rate of gun deaths among developed countries?

> **The US has the highest rate of gun deaths among developed countries because of its lax gun laws.**

- is this a question about "causes of effects" or "effects of causes"?
- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

- Does building a wall to keep immigrants out reduce violent crime?

> **The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.** - Donald Trump

- is this a question about "causes of effects" or "effects of causes"?
- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

The **descriptive claims** embedded in **causal claims** are of a specific type:

1. One is a claim about how the world actually is (**factual**)
2. One is a claim about how the world would look, if something were changed (**counterfactual**)

### **counterfactuals** are the key to causality

# Counterfactuals

## Causality is Counterfactual

### **What does that mean?**

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactuals**: are the way world **would be** if events had transpired differently (other than what actually took place).

- imagine an "alternate universe" or "alternate timeline"

constrasts to what is **factual**: the way the world is, given the events that have taken place.

# Spoiler Warning!

## Counterfactuals:

If Gwenyth Paltrow's character...

(a) **catches the train** then she catches her boyfriend cheating, and **dumps him**

(b) **does not catch the train** then she does not catch her boyfriend cheating, and **stays with him**

In reality, only **one** of these possibilities can happen. If (a) happens, it is **factual**, (b) is **counterfactual**

## An exercise {.build}

**Do public health restrictions on going to bars affect the patronage of bars?**

### Think and write...

If bars required **both** proof of vaccination **and** masking when not seated, would you go to a bar if your friends invited you?

If bars required **neither** proof of vaccination **nor** masking when not seated, would you go to a bar if your friends invited you?

Go to [menti.com](menti.com) and enter 6481 6421 or go to [https://www.menti.com/1avasbn4n1](https://www.menti.com/1avasbn4n1)

## An exercise

**Which of these is factual? Which is counterfactual**?

$1.$ If bars required **both** proof of vaccination **and** masking when not seated, would you go to a bar if your friends invited you?

>- (**factual**): this is the actual rule in the Province

$2.$ If bars required **neither** proof of vaccination **nor** masking when not seated, would you go to a bar if your friends invited you?

>- (**counterfactual**): this is not the rule in this province, but we can imagine an alternate universe in which it were.

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Counterfactuals can be described with **potential outcomes**:

If $X$ is a **variable** for a possible cause and $Y$ is a **variable** for what is possibly affected... 

then **potential outcomes** are the values of $Y$ a **specific case** would take for the different possible values of $X$ (both factual and counterfactual):

- would **you** go to a bar **today** if invited and vaccine and mask requirements were in place?
- would **you** go to a bar **today** if invited and vaccine and mask requirements were **NOT** in place?

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

**potential outcomes notation:**

Where $i$ corresponds to a specific case (e.g., you or Gwenyth Paltrow)

$\mathrm{Public \ Health \ Order}$ ($X$) is the causal variable (and can take different values, e.g. $yes, no$), then the potential outcomes of $\mathrm{Go \ to \ Bar}$ ($Y_i$) are:

$$\mathrm{Go \ to \ Bar}_{i}(PHO = yes), \mathrm{Go \ to \ Bar}_i(PHO = no)$$

For case $i$, $\mathrm{Public \ Health \ Order}$ can only ever be $yes$ or $no$: one potential outcome will become **factual** (it will happen), while the other will remain **counterfactual** (it won't happen)

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

$\mathrm{Love \ Life _{Gwenyth} (Catches \ the \ train )}$
$= \mathrm{Stay \ with \ cheating \ BF}$

$\mathrm{Love \ Life _{Gwenyth} (Doesn't \ catch \ the \ train )}$
$= \mathrm{Dump \ cheating \ BF}$

We only will observe **one** of these two possibilities. But both could **potentially** have happened.

**Draw potential outcomes on the board**

## Potential Outcomes: Caveat

In our example of **COVID Public Health Orders**:

- We are only **imagining**, as if omniscient, what you would do in the alternate universe where there are no rules for who can go to bars. We don't actually know. 
- Potential outcomes are what **you actually would do** in that alternate universe.

Even if we **don't know** what you would do if invited to a bar and the public health orders were not in place, can imagine that there is potential outcome of what you would do...

### **What do counterfactuals have to do with causality????**

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactual causality**

We can say that $X$ **causes** $Y$ for case $i$ if $Y_i(X = 1) \neq Y_i(X = 0)$:

- $X$ causes $Y$ if case $i$ would have behaved ($Y$) differently (than it did factually) in the (**counterfactual**) alternate universe where **everything was the same** except $X$ was changed.

REVISIT THE BOARD

# Example:

## Counterfactuals Example

> **"The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."** - Donald Trump

If this claim were true, what are the implied **potential outcomes**? 

- ask yourself: what variable corresponds to the "cause"? to the "effect"?

Which of these potential outcomes are **factual**? **counterfactual**?

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Trump's causal claim (implicitly): "The wall caused El Paso to have fewer murders".

Trump's counterfactual claim: "If there had been no wall, El Paso would have had more murders."

### Counterfactual claim implies two **potential outcomes**:

1. Number of murders in El Paso last year in the **presence** of the wall: $\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})$
2. Number of murders in El Paso last year in the **absence** of the wall $\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

If Trump's causal claim is **true** ("The wall caused El Paso to have fewer murders"), which should be true?

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})  < \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall}) > \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall}) = \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

> **"The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."**

Implies:

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})  < \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

If the claim is that "The wall caused El Paso to have fewer murders", or

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})  < \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

### ... What kind of evidence could you present assess whether the claim is true?
