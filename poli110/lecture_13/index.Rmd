# What is causality?

## What is causality?

All **causal claims** are **counterfactual claims**:

That is: they imply two **descriptive claims** of a specific type

1. One descriptive claim about how the world <u>is</u> **factually**;
    - what is the factual level of the alleged "cause"
    - what is the factual outcome (the thing affected)
2. One descriptive claim about how the world <u>would be</u> **counterfactually**
    - what would be the alternative level of the alleged cause
    - what would the outcome be **if the cause were different**
    
## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactuals**: are the way world **would be** if events had transpired differently (other than what actually took place).

- imagine an "alternate universe"

constrasts to what is **factual**: the way the world is, given the events that have taken place.

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Counterfactuals imply **potential outcomes**:

If $X$ is a **variable** that corresponds to a possible cause and $Y$ is a **variable** for what is possibly affected... 

then **potential outcomes** are the values of $Y$ a **specific case** would take for the different possible values of $X$ (both factual and counterfactual)

-  **potential** outcomes because they **could happen** but only one becomes factual, the others remain **counterfactual**.

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

$Y$ = Love Life of Gwenyth Paltrow's character in *Sliding Doors*

$X$ = Making the train (yes or no)

Only one story line will happen, the other will remain counterfactual (what would have happened).

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

And we can say that $X$ **causes** $Y$ for case $i$ if $Y_i(X = 1) \neq Y_i(X = 0)$:

- $X$ causes $Y$: if case $i$ would have behaved ($Y$) differently (than it did factually) in the (counterfactual) alternate universe where **everything was the same** except  for $X$.

- Same as saying: $X$ causes $Y$ if the potential outcomes of $Y$ are different for different values of $X$

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

All causal claims can be re-stated as **counterfactual claims**

- They contain a **conditional clause**, starting with "If" (always in the **subjunctive mood**)
- A "then" clause, stating what would happen if the **conditional**/**"If"** clause were true (always in the **conditional mood**)
- May be in past, present, or future tense.

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

### Example: Past

"Donald Trump's election victory caused an increase in hate crimes in 2017."

$$\underbrace{If \ \  Trump \ \ had \ \ not \ \ won \ \ the \ \ 2016 \ \ election}_{\text{If-clause in Subjunctive Mood}}, \\
\underbrace{there \ \ would \ \  have \ \ been \ \ fewer \ \ hate \ \ crimes \ \ in \ \ 2017.}_{\text{Then-clause in Conditional Mood}}$$


## Counterfactuals and Causality:

### Example: Present

"The presence of fraternities on campus cause more sexual assault."

$$\underbrace{If \ \  there \ \ were \ \ no \ \ fraternities \ \ on \ \ campus}_{\text{If-clause in Subjunctive Mood}}, \\ \underbrace{there \ \ would \ \  be \ \ fewer \ \ sexual \ \ assaults.}_{\text{Then-clause in Conditional Mood}}$$


## Counterfactuals and Causality:

Note: **Counterfactual claims get increasingly complicated, the more complicated your causal claim is**

- On assignments, exam do not come up with overly complex causal claims.

## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol>
<li> What are the **causes** of **effects**?
</ol></h3>

Want to explain something specific that has happened/we observe (**the effect**). Seek to **attribute** a cause for something we observe. 

- **"Why has the coronavirus become a global pandemic?"** 

---

### With your neighbors:

**1. Come up with a causal claim that answers the question "why has the coronavirus become a global pandemic?"**

**2. Restate the causal claim as a counterfactual claim**


## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol start=2>
<li> What are the **effects** of **causes**?
</ol></h3>

We want to know what happens if we do some action or some action (**the cause**) happens. (Could be a specific action or not) This is about the **contribution** of some cause to an effect.

- **What are the effects of school closures on the transmission of respiratory viruses?**
- **What are the effects of wearing surgical masks on respiratory virus infection?**

---

### With your neighbors:

**1. Come up with a causal claim that answers the question "What are the effects of school closures on the transmission of respiratory viruses?"**

**2. Restate the causal claim as a counterfactual claim**

# Varieties of Causal Claims

## Two ways of asking causal questions

Usually... different kinds of causal questions are answered with **different kinds of causal claims**

1. **deterministic** causal claims
2. **probabilistic** causal claims

## Deterministic Causal Claims

**deterministic causal claims**

- claims about what will happen with **certainty** under specific causal conditions
- whenever some **cause** (or set of causes) is present, the **effect** <u>**always**</u> happens
  - if the cause is present the effect is **determined** (unavoidable)
- usually make these claims when we are interested in **causes of effects**

## Probabilistic Causal Claims

### **probabilistic causal claims**

are claims that the presence/absence of a cause $C$ makes an effect $E$ more or less likely to occur. Or cause $C$ increases/decreases effect $E$ **on average**

- In contrast to **deterministic causal claims** this implies
    - effect $E$ can happen when $C$ is absent
    - effect $E$ may not happen when $C$ is present
- **NOT** a claim that politics has some inherent randomness (e.g. quantum mechanics)
- Usually make these claims when interested in **effects of causes**

## Deterministic Causal Claims

There are several varieties **and** combinations

- necessary conditions
- sufficient conditions
- conjunctural causation
- multiple causation

## Necessary Conditions

### **necessary conditions**

A causal claim that there is some cause $C$ **without which** the effect **cannot occur**

- A cause $C$ **must happen** in order for effect $E$ to happen.
- **Does not mean** if the cause $C$ is present, effect $E$ must happen, only **without** $C$, no $E$.

## Necessary Conditions: Example

A claim: "Without global air travel, a new infectious disease will not become a global pandemic."

Also can be stated: "Global air travel is a necessary condition for a new disease to become a pandemic."

## Map of Air Travel in 2015 {.centered}

<img src = "http://www.martingrandjean.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/airports-map.png" width=100%>

## Necessary Conditions: Example

If this claim is true: "Global air travel is a necessary condition for a new disease to become a pandemic."...

### Does the graph on preceding page imply that a new infectious disease will become a pandemic?

>- No. Presence of necessary condition $\not\to$ effect must happen

## Sufficient Conditions

(In contrast to **necessary conditions**)

### **sufficient conditions**

- are causes $C$ that **always** produce an effect $E$ when they are present
- they do not depend on other factors being present; cause $C$ can produce $E$ **by itself**
- Sufficient conditions imply: every time $C$ is present, then $E$ will happen 

## Sufficient Conditions: Example

**"Rapid spread of a respiratory disease is a sufficient condition for respiratory mask shortages."**

- This *might* be the case every time
- Does not appear to depend on other factors

#### Generally, single causes that are sufficient conditions are **rare** in social sciences

# Things are usually more complicated

### Why has the Syrian Civil War been so long?

Had it not been the case that...

>- Assad government/military tied to ethnic minority **and**
>- Experienced fighters from Iraq **and**
>- Assad backed by allies (Iran, Hezbollah, Russia) **and**
>- Insurgents backed by Gulf States, US **and**
>- Assad's opponents have conflicting goals

... the Syrian Civil war would not have been so long.

## Conjunctural Causation:

### **conjunctural causation**: 

When an effect $E$ depends on a combination of causes $(C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k)$

<h3><ol>
<li> **Multiple necessary conditions**
</ol></h3>

Effect $E$ only happens when some combination of causes $C_1, C_2$ is present

- If **not** $C_1$ *and* $C_2$, then **not** $E$.
- Example: plant growth requires **both** water and light are present

---

### **What causes a rise in anti-immigration sentiment**?

## Multiple Causation:
  
### **multiple causation**: 

Claim that **more than one** <u>sufficient</u> causes or set of causes ($C_1, C_2, \ldots C_k$) can produced the same effect $E$  

- $C_1 \to E$ **OR** $C_2 \to E$
- **conjunctural causation** also involves **multiple causes**, but the logic is different:
    - $NOT \ (C_1 \ and \ C_2) \to  NOT \ E$ (multiple necessary conditions)<footnote content="This is equivalent to: (Not C1) or (Not C2), thus not E."></footnote>
