# Variables <br> and Measures

## Variables and Measures:

### **variable**(s):

A **measurable property** of a case (phenomena, group, or individual) that corresponds to a **concept** or part of a concept (**dimension**) and can *potentially* take on different **values** across cases and time (it *vari*es across cases).

- Chosen to capture a concept
- Variables take on values for each case at a specific point in time
- *Vari*ation across **cases** or over **time**.
- General (e.g., "number of deaths in a civil war", not "number of deaths in the Syrian Civil War between 2011 and today")

## Variables and Measures:

### **measure**(s)

A **procedure** for determining the *value* a variable takes for **specific cases** based on **observation**.

- Measures are proposed to determine the **value** a variable takes for some cases
- They are always for some specific cases we want to know about (e.g., a procedure for estimating deaths in the Syrian Civil War)


## A Trivial Example:

### **A descriptive question:**

What is the tallest mountain on the North Shore?

### **We need to:**

- define a the concept of "tall"/"height"
- create a variable that matches that definition and is measurable
- develop a procedure to obtain values of that variable for mountains on the North Shore

## Concept to Measurement: 

### Concept: Height (of a mountain)

Elevation of peak above sea level

 

### $\xrightarrow{}$ Variable: 

Vertical distance in meters from the Burrard Inlet to the top of the peak

 
### $\xrightarrow{}$  Measure:

Use difference in barometric pressure to calculate difference in elevation

##  Concept to Measurement:

<img src='./prominence.jpg'>

Are you going to climb the mountain? Prominence might be a better concept of height.


## Concept to Measurement:

### Concept: Height (of a mountain)

Prominence of peak compared to nearby mountains


### $\xrightarrow{}$  Variable: 

Vertical distance in meters from top of the peak to lowest contour line surrounding it and no other higher peaks.

  

### $\xrightarrow{}$ Measure:

Satellites using radar interferometry create topographical maps; computer algorithm to find lowest contour


## Concept to Measurement:

Different concepts $\to$ different variables

<br>

Different variables $\to$ different measures

<br>

Different Answer:

- Using elevation from sea level, West Lion is taller
- Using prominence, Seymour is taller.

# Variables

## Variables

**variables**:

- take on **values** for each specific case at a specific point in time.
    - values vary between cases at the same point in time
    - values vary within cases at different points in time
- take different **kinds of values**


## Variables: Example

**A question:** Did hate crimes increase in the United State following the election of Donald Trump?

**Concept:** "criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offenderâ€™s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity." - FBI

**Variable**: Number of hate crimes occurring in a calendar year.

---

What **values** can this variable take?

<img src='./hate_crimes.jpg' width=90%>



## Variables: Example

**Number of hate crimes:**

- Integer (no fractional hate crimes)
- $0$ or more

**Variations:**

- Hate Crimes Per Capita?
- Hate Crime Victimization Rate? (fraction of persons in group $g$ who experience a hate crime against group $g$)

## Variables: Example

<img src='./toronto_languages.jpg' width=100%>

## Variables: Example

"The first language learned by a person." (mother tongue)

This is a variable: what values does it take?

>- Categories
>- No numeric range
>- One language is not "higher"/"lower" than another.

## Variables

The kinds of **values** taken by a **variable** is called its **level of measurement**

#### Four **levels of measurement**

<br>

- **Nominal**
- **Ordinal**
- **Interval**
- **Ratio**

#### Not to be confused with **measures**

## Levels of measurement: <u>nominal</u>

**nominal** levels of measurement: 

- place cases into **unranked** categories
- discrete groups based on presence/absence of attribute(s)
- no category is "more" or "less" than another
- categories are exhaustive (every case can fit in a category)
    - sometimes we just have "other"

### Examples:

- Religion
- Pastisan affiliation
- Regime type (e.g. minimalist democracy vs non-democracy)
- Type of crime (e.g.  hate vs. economic vs. personal etc.)

## Levels of measurement: <u>ordinal</u>

**ordinal** levels of measurement 

- place cases into categories that are ranked
- may have a number attached (or not)
- Cases can be said to have **more** or **less** of something
- Intervals between categories **not meaningful**
- **relative** levels, **not absolute** levels

### Examples:

- University rankings
- Test score percentiles
- Ideology (very liberal, somewhat liberal, neither, somewhat conservative, very conservative)

## Levels of measurement: <u>interval</u>

**interval** levels of measurement 

- assign cases **numbers** that **rank** the cases 
- have intervals between values are meaningful and consistent (1 unit change is the same size each time)
- difference in values indicates **how much** more or less of something case has from another
- no meaningful zero point, ratios not meaningful

### Examples

- Years (but not years since some event)
- Temperature (in Celsius, but not Kelvin)
- Left/Right ideology scores

## Levels of measurement: <u>ratio</u>

**ratio** levels of measurement 

- assign cases **numbers** that **rank** the cases
- have **intervals** that are **meaningful** and consistent
- difference in values indicates **how much** more or less
- **zero indicates absence**
- ratios meaningful (something can be twice as much as something else)

### Examples

- Years since some event
- Counts of events
- Rates (unemployment, language spoken, political party preference)


## Example: Gun Violence

What is the level of measurement?

1. Cause of death?
1. Number of gun deaths?
3. Change over time in number of gun deaths
5. Proportion of all murders that involve guns
6. Strictness of gun ownership regulations
7. Year in which a country bans assault weapons

## Example: Gun Violence

What is the level of measurement?

1. Cause of death? (**nominal**)
1. Number of gun deaths? (**ratio**)
3. Change over time in number of gun deaths (**ratio**)
5. Proportion of all murders that involve guns (**ratio**)
6. Strictness of gun ownership regulations (**ordinal**)
7. Year in which a country bans assault weapons (**interval**)


## Types of Variables

Variables also give values in **absolute** and **relative** units.

#### **absolute** values are counts given in raw **units**

Examples: dollar amounts, Number of events, Number of deaths

#### **relative** values are given in fractions or rates or ranks 

Examples:

- Units are fractional (GDP per capita, deaths/population, events/time)
- No units (percentile, rankings)

## Types of Variables
 
#### Suppose we want to compare the US states to see if those with lax gun laws had more gun deaths:

<br>

### **Which variable would be best?**

1. Number of gun deaths in the preceding year
2. Rank of the state on a list of states ordered by gun deaths in the preceding year
3. Gun deaths per 100,000 people in the preceding year

# Validity

## Variables can fail:

Even if we develop a useful concept...

### **variables may not correspond to the concept**

## Variable Trouble: Validity

#### **validity**: 

- Degree of fit between a variables the concept the variable is intended to capture.
- When a variable  "captures" or "maps onto" the concept we are interested in, then we say they have "validity"
- When a variable "captures" or "maps onto" other concepts we are not interested in, then we say they lack "validity"


## Variable Trouble: Validity

"Which country/province is most politically corrupt?"

**Concept**: <u>Political Corruption</u> or "the use of power by government officials for illegitimate private gain"

**Variable**: Fraction of politicians in a place prosecuted for corruption

**Measure**: Match criminal court defendants in corruption prosecutions to list of politicians.

### Does this variable have **validity**?

---

"Which country/province is most politically corrupt?"

**Concept**: <u>Political Corruption</u> or "the use of power by government officials for illegitimate private gain"

**Variable**: Fraction of politicians in a place prosecuted for corruption

**Measure**: Match criminal court defendants in corruption prosecutions to list of politicians.

### Problems

- Places with lots of corruption do not prosecute corruption
- Places with low corruption successfully prosecute corruption
- Places have different corruption laws.
- But the **measure** may give correct values for the **variable**


## Variable Trouble: Validity

"How often are guns used for self-defense?"

**Concept**: <u>Self Defense Gun Use</u>: "resistance to a **crime** through display or use of a firearm"

**Variable**: Number of times people displayed or used a firearm with the aim of protecting themselves or their property against another person? 

**Measure**: Randomly survey people about their use of firearms, including questions about use of firearms to protect themselves or property.

### Does this variable have **validity**?

---

"How often are guns used for self-defense?"

**Concept**: <u>Self Defense Gun Use</u>: "resistance to a **crime** through display or use of a firearm"

**Variable**: Number of times people displayed or used a firearm with the aim of protecting themselves or their property against another person? 

**Measure**: Randomly survey people about their use of firearms, including questions about use of firearms to protect themselves or property.

### Problems

- People misperceive crimes that are not happening (different from mis-reporting) (validity problem)
- Survey respondents mis-report threat or use of a weapon (different from mis-perception) (measurement error)


## Variable Trouble: Validity

"Societies that are ethnically diverse are less likely to be democracies"

**Concept**: Ethnic Diversity: presence of multiple distinct and socially relevant ethnic groups

**Variable**: Probability that any two random individuals belong to different ethnic groups 

**Measure**: Measure number and size of ethnic groups using Soviet anthropological atlas from 1964, calculate probability using equation

### Does this variable have **validity**?

---

"Societies that are ethnically diverse are less likely to be democracies"

**Concept**: Ethnic Diversity: presence of multiple distinct and socially relevant ethnic groups

**Variable**: Probability that any two random individuals belong to different ethnic groups 

**Measure**: Measure number and size of ethnic groups using Soviet anthropological atlas from 1964, calculate probability using equation

### Problems

- Which kind of ethnicity (e.g. language, religion, race, caste, tribe)
- Not all ethnic categories are socially relevant

## **Threats to validity**

1. Measure/Variable does not cover **enough** of the concept:
    - Measure only captures some but not all relevant **dimensions** of the concept
    - e.g. probability two people from different ethnic groups
2. Measure/Variable covers things **outside** the concept:
    - Could cover somethings inside the concept, or **nothing** inside the concept
    - e.g. fraction of politicians convicted of corruption 
    - e.g. survey of reported self-defense gun uses
3. Measure captures different things across units: **non-comparability**
    - e.g. fraction of politicians convicted of corruption 

## Objectives

1. Distinguish between Variables and Measures
2. Variables:

    - levels of measurement 
    - absolute/relative
    
3. Validity
  
    - what is it? 
    - why do variables not have it?
