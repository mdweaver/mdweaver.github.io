# Varieties of <br> Empirical Claims

## Varieties of Claims

### **Which varieties of claims/questions can be addressed with science?**

### Three dimensions

1. Empirical vs. Normative
2. **Varieties of empirical** and normative claims/questions
3. **Falsifiable vs. unfalsifiable**

## Some empirical claims

1. **In 2018, Canada had 0.67 firearms homicides per 100K while the US had 3.14 per 100K.**

2. **The United States has more assault weapons per capita and more mass shooting victims than Canada**

3. **Canada has fewer firearms deaths per capita than the US because Canada has stricter gun laws.**

4. **Americans use guns in self-defense about 2.3 million times per year.**

5. **People who openly carry a firearm are less likely to be victims of crimes**

6. **Making it easier to legally carry a concealed firearms increases firearms deaths.**


## Descriptive claims:

### **descriptive claims:**

claims about what exists (or has existed/will exist) in the world: 

- **what phenomena exist** (what kinds of things exist?)
- **what is the type of a specific phenomenon** (what is this thing?)
- **amount/frequency of phenomena** (how much of something is there?)
- **relative amount/frequency of phenomena across different places/times** (how much of something is there here vs. there/now vs. then?)
- **what patterns are there in the shared appearance/non-appearance of different phenomena** (does this thing usually appear together with that other thing?)

## Which of these are descriptive?

(1) **About 1.1 million refugees entered Germany during 2015.** (descriptive)

(2) **The vast majority of these refugees came from Syria and other parts of the Middle East.** (descriptive)

(4) **"Illegal mass migration undermines the opportunities in life for socially worse off Germans."**

(5) **This influx in refugees *increased* violent crime.**

## Causal claims:

### **causal claims**:

are claims about the how one phenomena ($X$) affects or causes another phenomena ($Y$). Causal claims state that $X$ **acts on** $Y$ in some way, not merely that they appear together in some pattern:

- the **effect** that one thing or event has on another thing (effects of causes)
- the **cause** of some event or thing in the world (causes of effects)
- the *conditions* under which some thing or event *happens* (causes of effects)
- the *process* through which one thing affects another (causes of effects)

## Which of these are causal?

(1) **About 1.1 million refugees entered Germany during 2015.** (descriptive)

(2) **The vast majority of these refugees came from Syria and other parts of the Middle East.** (descriptive)

(4) **"Illegal mass migration *undermines* the opportunities in life for socially worse off Germans."** (causal)

(5) **This influx in refugees *increased* violent crime.** (causal)


## **How to recognize causal claims** 

(compared to descriptive claims)

### Causal claims include some kind of  **causal verb (or phrase)**. E.g.:

-  (non-exhaustive list): "causes", "influences","makes happen", "increases", "decreases", "results in", "was necessary for", etc.
- can always be restated as a phrase with a verb, subject, and some object, where subject is the cause and object (or one of the objects) is the affected thing.
- can always be restated as a phrase like "$X$ causes $Y$ to change in some way" or "$Y$ changes in some way because of $X$"

$1$. Canada had 0.67 firearms homicides/100k; the US had 3.14.

$2$. US has more assault weapons and more mass shooting victims than Canada


<div>
$3$. Canada has fewer gun deaths than the US because of stricter gun laws.

$4$. Guns are used in self-defense 2.3 mil times in US.

$5$. People who open-carry a gun are less likely to be victims

$6$. Easier concealed carry increases gun deaths
</div>

</div>

##  **How to recognize causal claims** 

(compared to descriptive claims)

### Causal claims always imply: *if* **we** could directly **manipulate** one thing $X$, then we would see $Y$ change


## Turn these into causal claims:

1. **In 2018, Canada had 0.67 firearms homicides per 100K while the US had 3.14 per 100K.**

2. **The United States has more assault weapons per capita and more mass shooting victims than Canada**

4. **Americans use guns in self-defense about 2.3 million times per year.**

5. **People who openly carry a firearm are less likely to be victims of crimes**

# Digression

## Causal and Prescriptive Claims

You and your friend agree: **the most important ethical goal is minimizing human death** (**value judgment**)

### You disagree on what to do:

(1) We should donate mosquito nets to stop malaria (**prescriptive claim**)

(2) We should give money directly to impoverished people (**prescriptive claim**)

### Need to know:

Which option **prevents** the most human deaths? (a **causal** question)?

# Falsifiability

## Which claims can science evaluate? 

### **\#NotAllEmpiricalClaims testable with science**

## Falsifiability

### an empirical claim is  **falsifiable**...

- if that claim **could be shown to be wrong** by some **empirical evidence**. 

- Even if we **never** conclude that the claim is wrong, it would be possible to **observe** evidence to prove it wrong.

- e.g. The Earth orbits the Sun.

### an empirical claim is **unfalsifiable**...

- if there is no **empirical evidence** that could show the claim is wrong.

## Falsifiability

### **Because science considers alternatives/is open to being wrong...**

<br>

we can only **scientifically** evaluate **claims** that can, **could** be shown to be wrong. 

Only empirical claims that are **falsifiable** are open to scientific inquiry.

## Falsifiability

### Contrast with **verifiability**

If we had an empirical claim, $H_1$ ($H$ for hypothesis)

and, if $H_1$ were true or valid, then it implies we should make certain empirical observations $O_1$

Verification says that

1. $H_1 \rightarrow O_1$

2. If we see $O_1$

3. Therefore, $H_1$ is valid

## Falsifiability

Many people reject **verifiability** because many different, incompatible claims are compatible with the same observed evidence

1. $(H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_k) \rightarrow O_1$

2. If we observe $O_1$

3. $H_1$ is not proven

## Falsifiability

If a claim $H_1$ is falsfiable, there might be observable implication $O_1$ that, if it were untrue would invalidate $H_1$. So...

1. $H_1 \rightarrow  O_1$
2. $not\ O_1$
3. Therefore, $not\ H_1$


## Examples

$H_1:$ **"Immigrants are coming across the border to kill you"** ~ [Donald Trump](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/8/18174782/trump-speech-immigration-border)

<u>**Verification**</u>

1. $H_1 \rightarrow$ Murder committed by an "illegal immigrant"

2. There has been a murder by an "illegal immigrant" [see here](https://globalnews.ca/video/4401017/trump-slams-illegal-immigration-cites-mollie-tibbetts-murder)

3. Therefore, "Immigrants are coming across the border to kill you"

## Examples

$H_1:$ **"Immigrants are coming across the border to kill you"**   
$H_2:$ **"One immigrant committed murder"**   
$H_3:$ **"Two immigrants committed murder"**   
$H_4:$ **"Immigrants are less prone to murder than native born citizens"**

<u>**Verification?**</u>

1. $(H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4 \dots H_k) \rightarrow$ Murder committed by an "illegal immigrant"

2. There has been a murder by an "illegal immigrant" [see here](https://globalnews.ca/video/4401017/trump-slams-illegal-immigration-cites-mollie-tibbetts-murder)

3. Therefore, $H_1, H_2, H_3, or\ H_4$ could be valid


## Example: Lizard People

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wZ_4uh2eG7U/maxresdefault.jpg" width =90%>

$H_1$: **World leaders are actually lizard people who seek to dominate humans**
 
## Lizard People: Verification

$O_1$: **World leaders exhibit lizard traits** 

<img src='./lizard_p0.png' width = 75%>


## Lizard People: Verification

We observe $O_1$:

<img src='./lizard_p1.png' width = 75%>

## Lizard People: Verification

$O_1 \to H_1$: **Bow down before your lizard overlords**

<img src="./lizard_overlords.png" width=80%>

## Lizard People: Unfalsifiable

How would we **falsify**?

1. $H_1$: **World leaders are actually lizard people who seek to dominate humans** $\to ?$

2. $not \ ?$

3. $not \ H_1 ?$

What observable implication of this could be proven wrong?

# Objectives

## Lessons

What kinds of claims can science evaluate?

1. **Empirical** vs. Normative
2. **Varieties of empirical** and normative claims/questions
    - causal, descriptive
3. **Falsifiable**/unfalsifiable
