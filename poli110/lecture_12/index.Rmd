## Objectives

### **1. Descriptive Conclusion**

### **2. Intro to Causality**

- **What is causality?**
- **Counterfactuals**
- **Potential Outcomes**


# Descriptive Claims

## Evaluating Descriptive Claims:

1. **Claim $\rightarrow$**
2. **Concept(s)** $\rightarrow$
3. **Variable(s)** $\rightarrow$
4. **Measure** $\rightarrow$
5. **Draw a Conclusion** $\rightarrow$ **Claim**

# Causality

## Why causality?

**Recall** some of Weber's insights:

### 1. **science is about prediction**

### 2. **science cannot tell us what to do**, but it can provide **clarity**

- For us, **clarity** means knowing what actions achieve our goals, which do not, and how certain actions might put our values into conflict.

## Why causality?

**In other terms**:

### Science can only help answer **prescriptive questions** by evaluating **causal claims**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

### Without evidence for **causal claims**, we can't make rational decisions about **prescriptive claims**

## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol>
<li> What are the **causes** of **effects**?
</ol></h3>

Want to explain something specific that has happened/we observe (**the effect**). Seek to **attribute** a cause for something we observe. 

- Why did millions of refugees head to Europe in 2015-2016?
- Why are housing prices very high in Vancouver?

## Two ways of asking causal questions

<h3><ol start=2>
<li> What are the **effects** of **causes**?
</ol></h3>

We want to know what happens if we do some action or some action (**the cause**) happens. (Could be a specific action or not) This is about the **contribution** of some cause to an effect.

- Has BC's housing speculation tax reduced housing prices? 
- What are the effects of restricting gun ownership on gun violence?

## Two ways of asking causal questions

### Looking at **effects of causes** versus **causes of effects**  leads to different approaches to scientific investigation

**causes of effects**
$$\textrm{?} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{effect}$$


**effects of causes**
$$\textrm{cause} \xrightarrow{} \textrm{?}$$



# What is causality?

## What is causality?

### all **causal claims** are a specific combination of two descriptive claims

<br>

- sometimes these descriptive claims are **explicit**, often they are **implied**.

## What is causality?

Why does the US have the highest rate of gun deaths among developed countries?

> **The US has the highest rate of gun deaths among developed countries because of its lax gun laws.**

- "causes of effects" or "effects of causes"?
- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

- Does building a wall to keep immigrants out reduce violence crime?

> **The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.** - Donald Trump

- "causes of effects" or "effects of causes"?
- What are the two descriptive claims in this causal claim?

## What is causality?

The **descriptive claims** embedded in **causal claims** are of a specific type:

1. One is (or will be) **factual**
2. One is **counterfactual**

### **counterfactuals** are the key to causality

# Counterfactuals

## Causality is Counterfactual

### **What does that mean?**

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

**counterfactuals**: are the way world **would be** if events had transpired differently (other than what actually took place).

- imagine an "alternate universe"

constrasts to what is **factual**: the way the world is, given the events that have taken place.

## An exercise

**Think about how you behave under two different circumstances:**

How long would you study for the midterm in two weeks...

1. if a 100% on the midterm would mean you add 20 points to your final grade (out of 100) in the course. Less than 100% would add $x\% \times 20$ points
2. if a 100% on the midterm would mean add **100** points to your final grade (out of 100) in the course. Less than 100% would add $x\% \times 20$ points. (100 on midterm means 100 in the course)

>- `menti.com 26 04 37`

## An exercise

**Which of these is factual? Which is counterfactual**?

$1.$ if a 100% on the midterm would mean you add 20 points to your final grade (out of 100) in the course. Less than 100% would add $x\% \times 20$ points 

>- (**factual**): this is the actual rule in this course

$2.$ if a 100% on the midterm would mean add **100** points to your final grade (out of 100) in the course. Less than 100% would add $x\% \times 20$ points 

>- (**counterfactual**): this is not the rule in this course, but we imagine an alternate universe in which it were.


## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Counterfactuals imply **potential outcomes**:

If $X$ is a **variable** for a possible cause and $Y$ is a **variable** for what is possibly affected... 

then **potential outcomes** are the values of $Y$ a **specific case** would take for the different possible values of $X$ (both factual and counterfactual)

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

**potential outcomes notation:**

Where $i$ corresponds to a specific case, and $X$ is the causal variable (and can take two values: $1,0$), then the potential outcomes of $Y_i$ are:

$$Y_i(X = 1), Y_i(X = 0)$$

For case $i$, $X$ can only ever be $1$ or $0$: one potential outcome will become **factual** (it will happen), while the other will be **counterfactual** (it won't happen)

**These are potential outcomes**

## Counterfactuals and Causality:

And we can say that $X$ **causes** $Y$ for case $i$ if $Y_i(X = 1) \neq Y_i(X = 0)$:

- $X$ causes $Y$: if case $i$ would have behaved ($Y$) differently (than it did factually) in the (counterfactual) alternate universe where **everything was the same** except  for $X$.

- Same as saying: $X$ causes $Y$ if the potential outcomes of $Y$ are different for different values of $X$

# 

## Potential Outcomes: Caveat

In our example of **midterm studying**:

- We will only ever observe your hours spent studying ($Y$) in the world where 100 on the midterm $\to +20\%$ of your final grade.
- We are only **imagining**, as if omniscient, what you would do in the alternate universe. We don't actually know.

# Example:


## Counterfactuals Example

> **"The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."** - Donald Trump

If this claim is true, what are the implied **potential outcomes** (of violent crime)?

Which of these potential outcomes are **factual**? **counterfactual**?

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

Trump's causal claim (implicitly): "The wall caused El Paso to have fewer murders".

Trump's counterfactual claim: "If there had been no wall, El Paso would have had more murders."

### Counterfactual claim implies two **potential outcomes**:

1. Number of murders in El Paso last year in the **presence** of the wall: $\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})$
2. Number of murders in El Paso last year in the **absence** of the wall $\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

If Trump's causal claim is **true** ("The wall caused El Paso to have fewer murders"), which should be true?

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})  < \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall}) > \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall}) = \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

## Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes

> **"The border city of El Paso, Tex., used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."**

Implies:

$$\textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{Wall})  < \textrm{Murders}_{\textrm{El Paso}}(\textrm{No Wall})$$

Why might this be hard to prove?
