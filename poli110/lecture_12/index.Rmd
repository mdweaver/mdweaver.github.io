## Voter Fraud

Richman et al:

- two large, random sample of adult Americans in 2008, 2010 (~**33,000 and 55,400 people**)
- identify a **sample of non-citizens**: respondents who indicate on the survey that they are non-citizens ($N = 489$, or about $1\%$ of people in 2010) 
- count who among the "non-citizen sample" voted ($13$) (validated voting measure - matched to public voter file)
- conclude that 3.5% of non-citizens voted in 2010 (~700k), up to 14.7% in 2008 (~2.8 million people)

### So, wait, was Trump right?

**Discuss: Do you find this persuasive? Why or why not?**

#

## Two Big Problems:

### Problem One: Measurement Error

The political scientists who run the survey point out: 

- Citizenship question suffers from (low) measurement error. 
- Those surveyed in both 2010 and 2012: $99.7\%$ gave the same answer on citizenship, $0.19\%$ went from "non-citizen" to "citizen" (maybe true), $0.11\%$ went from **"citizen" to "non-citizen" (definitely false)**
- **measurement error:** misclassifies $0.1\%$ of people (1 out of a 1000)

>- to the board

## Two Big Problems:

### Problem Two: Sampling Error

**measurement error** of individuals as citizens/non-citizens, leads Richman et al to sample of "non-citizens" that include **citizens** and non-citizens:

- citizens $\gg$ non-citizens $\to$ many more **citizens** who are **misclassified** as **"non-citizens"**
- We have **sampling error**... the sample does not reflect the population Richman et al/ Trump want to make inferences about.
- It could be that the "non-citizen" voting is driven entirely by voting among citizens who clicked the wrong button on the survey.

## Two Big Problems:

<img src="./ansolabehere.png" width=100%>

Nobody who consistently reports being a non-citizen votes.

## Two Big Problems:

**Measurement Error** (of individuals' citizenship) 

$\Downarrow produces$

**Sampling Error** (sample that should represent **non-citizens** includes **citizens**) 

$\Downarrow produces$

**Measurement Error** (about the *population of non-citizens*)

$\Downarrow$

authors make incorrect claims that hundreds of thousands of non-citizens vote illegally.

#

## In more detail

### Overall Problem:

1. Richman et al/ Trump want to make claims about the **population**  of all non-citizens. They use a **sample**.
2. The **sample** is generated based on individual survey responses to a questions that are **wrong** for $0.1\%$ of individuals (**measurement error**)
3. This generates **sampling bias** as the sample systematically includes **citizens** who are treated as representative of "non-citizens"
4. Because Richman et al/ Trump are using the sample to make inferences about the **population** of non-citizens, the **sampling bias** produces **measurement bias**: systematically over-estimating noncitizen voting.

### **Measure**(s)

- how do we measure these observable indicators of racial bias?  $\xrightarrow{}$

### Answer?

## Racial Bias: Concept

### How should we define of racial bias?

[Fryer (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1086/701423) defines racial bias as **differential treatment** of different racial groups attributable to "taste-based" (as opposed to "statistical") discrimination.

## Racial Bias: Concept

**statistical discrimination:**

inequality that exists between demographic groups even though economic agents (police, consumers, workers, employers, etc.) are rational and non-prejudiced. 

- Discrimination can be "rational" if individual attributes are hard to observe (e.g. propensity toward crime) while group membership is observable and different groups have different behaviors on average.
- Discrimination is "rational" if relevant considerations ('objective threat', criminal activity) objectively correlate with group membership


## Racial Bias: Concept

**taste-based discrimination:**

discrimination based on a preference to treat groups differently based solely on their membership in those groups

## Racial Bias: Concept

A focus on racial bias as **taste-based discrimination** leads social scientists to conceive of racial bias in policing as:

- when two people who are different races but have "all else equal" are treated differently by the police.

>- Do you agree with this conceptual definition of racial bias? Is there anything you think this definition **misses** that should count at "racial bias"?

## Racial Bias: Concept

[Lily Hu](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/direct-effects/) questions whether it makes sense to think of racial bias in this way:

Given the legacy of slavery, explicit and sometimes state-sponsored and private discrimination by race, there are large income and wealth disparities between Black and white Americans.

Does it make sense to say: "People who are poorer are more likely to be killed by the police, regardless of race. Due to racial inequalities in wealth, a greater fraction of Black Americans are poor. Some portion of the gap in police killings of white and Black Americans is explained by these racial differences in wealth; those killings are not part of 'racial bias'."?


> "Why would we expect the way race 'causes' police killings to stay the same in a world in which Black people and white people had the exact same income or wealth distribution?" 

## Racial Bias: Concept

While we might dispute whether Fryer's definition of racial bias **is correct**...

... we can still **use** his concept to test whether there is racial bias in police shootings, because it is a transparent definition based on observable traits that are what it means to "have racial bias".

But the evidence that Fryer presents is not guaranteed to speak to *other* definitions of racial bias we may think are better.

Is there racial bias in police use of force? $\xrightarrow{}$

### **Concept**

- "taste based discrimination" $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{disputed \ definition!}}$

### **Variable**(s)

- what are observable indicators of racial bias? $\xrightarrow{}$

### **Measure**(s)

- how do we measure these observable indicators of racial bias?  $\xrightarrow{}$

### Answer?

## Racial Bias: Variable

Fryer (2019) uses this variable to capture taste-based discrimination:

**differences in stop outcome**: racial bias is the observed differences **between racial groups** in the **rate** at which police use force (a firearm) on people **stopped by the police** who are **otherwise similar on other attributes** (suspect demographics, officer demographics, circumstances of the stop). 

>- Does this variable have validity (capture "taste-based discrimination")

## Racial Bias: Validity?

[Knox et al (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policing/66BC0F9998543868BB20F241796B79B8) raise concerns that these variables lack validity:

- If there is **racial bias in police stops**, then this variable lacks validity. It will underestimate taste-based discrimination.

Is there racial bias in police use of force? $\xrightarrow{}$

### **Concept**

- "taste based discrimination" $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{disputed \ definition!}}$

### **Variable**(s)

- racial disparity in use of force among those who are stopped $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{underestimates \ bias}}$

### **Measure**(s)

- how do we measure these observable indicators of racial bias?  $\xrightarrow{}$

### Answer?

## Racial Bias: Measure

**Data sourced from police records**

- **Sample of Police Departments**:
  - solicited police reports on incidents when officers discharged their weapons from 20 departments (not chosen at random) 
  - only Houston, TX provided complete data on shootings and stops

## Racial Bias: Measure

**From police records**

**Sample of 'Stops'**:

  - data on **all** Officer Involved Shootings in Houston (2000-2015)
  - but 16 million arrests in (2000-2015)
  - randomly sample arrests for "attempted murder of a public safety officer, aggravated assault on a public safety officer, resisting arrest, evading arrest, and interfering in an arrest."

Compare people shot by police to a sample of people who "could have been shot".

## Racial Bias: Measure

**Coded from sample of police reports**: to determine "otherwise similar encounters"

- Suspect characteristics: **race**, age, gender
- Suspect weapon: type of weapon suspect used or had in possession (including 'none')
- Officer characteristics: race of office/unit, gender of officers, years on force, on duty, number of officers present
- Officer response reason: reason why the officer was there (e.g. responding to robbery, suspicious activity) 
- Other encounter characteristics: daytime/nighttime, suspect attacked first, suspect drew (attempted to draw) weapon

## Racial Bias: Measure

Based on these details of measurement procedures: discuss with your neighbors:

Do you have any concerns about...

- sampling bias?
- measurement bias?
- (large) random measurement error?$^*$

What are they and why?

## Racial Bias: Measure

**Police reports as a source**:

- attributes of police encounter may be misreported
- incentive to misrepresent to justify use of force
- prejudiced perceptions recorded in police reports
- e.g. police may search some groups for weapons/drugs more than others (may mis-measure "possession of a weapon")

## Racial Bias: Measure

**Sampling bias**:

- which cities share data on police shootings with researchers?
- which shooting reports do cities share?

Insofar as Fryer is interested in describing racial bias in policing in the United States, sample of cities may suffer from sampling bias.
