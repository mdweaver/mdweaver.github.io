# Causal Claims

## Plan for Today:

### **(1) Deterministic Causal Claims**

Review:

- necessary conditions
- sufficient conditions
- conjunctural causation

New:

- multiple causation

### **(2) Probabilistic Causal Claims**

# Deterministic Causal Claims

## Necessary/Sufficient Conditions

### **necessary conditions**

A claim that there is some cause $C$ **without which** the effect **cannot occur**

- If **not** $C$ then **not** $E$

### **sufficient conditions**

A claim that there is a cause $C$ that, on its own, always produces effect $E$

- If  $C$ then $E$

# Things are usually more complicated

## Conjunctural Causation:

### **conjunctural causation**: 

When an effect $E$ depends on a combination of causes $(C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k)$

This can take two forms:

<h3><ol>
<li> **Multiple necessary conditions**
</ol></h3>

Effect $E$ only happens when some combination of causes $C_1, C_2$ is present

- If **not** $C_1$ *and* $C_2$, then **not** $E$.

## Conjunctural Causation:

<h3><ol start = 2>
<li> **Conditional Effects**
</ol></h3>

Effect $E$ of cause $C_1$ differs depending on some other factor $C_2$

- If $C_1$ and **not** $C_2$, then $E_1$; If $C_1$ **and** $C_2$, then $E_2$
- Exposure to Nazi Radio Propaganda (in 1930s) caused
    - **increase** in anti-Semitic violence in communities with **history of pogroms**
    - **decrease** in anti-Semitic violence in communities with **no history of pogroms**


## Multiple Causation:
  
### **multiple causation**: 

Claim that **more than one** sufficient causes or set of causes ($C_1, C_2, \ldots C_k$) can produced the same effect $E$  

- $C_1 \to E$ **OR** $C_2 \to E$
- **conjunctural causation** also involves **multiple causes**, but the logic is different:
    - $NOT \ (C_1 \ and \ C_2) \to  NOT \ E$ (multiple necessary conditions)<footnote content="This is equivalent to: (Not C1) or (Not C2), thus not E."></footnote>


## Multiple Causation: Example

### **What causes a rise in anti-immigration sentiment**?

Rise in anti-immigration sentiment caused by:

- Terrorist attack/major crime perpetrated by a non-citizen

**or**

- Increase in unemployment/competition for jobs

**or**

- Increase in popularity of ethno-nationalist ideology

Each of these is a **sufficient** cause, so it is  **multiple causation**
    
## What is this, though?

### **What causes a building to burn**?

A building will burn when:

- The $(A)$ the building has a wood frame and $(B)$ there is a short circuit in electrical wiring

**OR**

- In the building there is $(C)$ a can of gasoline that is next to $(D)$ a furnace with an ignition

### **Multiple causation? Conjunctural causation?**
    
## Multiple and Conjunctural Causation

### It is **both**

**Multiple sufficient** conditions for a building to burn; each sufficient condition has **multiple necessary** conditions

1. $(A)$ wood frame **and** $(B)$ short circuit

2. $(C)$ gas can **and** $(D)$ furnace

### This **very common** in reality

## Multiple and Conjunctural

### **Why do civil wars happen?**

- $C_1$: ethnic diversity **AND** $C_2$: political inequality between groups (e.g., Sri Lanka; Kurds in Turkey)

**OR**

- $C_3$: interference by foreign governments **AND** $C_4$: left-right ideological polarization (e.g., Nicaragua; Spain)

## INUS Conditions

**You will not be assessed on this** (but it might be helpful)

Because causality can be complex, we say that: **Something is a cause $C$ of effect $E$ if**

$C$ is [**I**]nsufficient  but [**N**]ecessary  part of a **condition** which is itself [**U**]nnecessary but exclusively [**S**]ufficient for the effect $E$

**Example**: Wood frame is a **cause** of building fire, because

1. $(A)$ Wood frame **and** $(B)$ short circuit is **[S]**ufficient for fire.
2. $(A)$ **and** $(B)$ **[U]**nnecessary for fire (b/c there are other ways).
3. $(A)$ Wood is **[N]**ecessary for $(B)$ short circuit to produce fire.
4. $(A)$ Wood by itself is **[I]**nsufficient to produce fire.

## Deterministic Causal Claims

When we seek to investigate **causes of effects** (we focus on an effect and attribute causes that produce it)...

in principle, there is a list of **all** conditions (conjunctural or otherwise) under which effect will always or never occur

- e.g. a list of all combinations of conditions that can create the effect of a building burning.
- such a list would let you **determine exactly** when effect occurs vs not.

## Deterministic Causal Claims

When we seek to investigate **effects of causes** (we reverse focus and look at causes and what effects they produce), 

### does it make sense to speak **deterministically**?

e.g., does it make sense to claim:

- "Wood framing causes buildings to burn down (every time)?"
- "Short circuits cause buildings to burn down (every time)?"
- "Presence of indoor gas furnaces cause buildings to burn down (every time)?"

## Probabilistic Causal Claims

When we are interested in **effects of causes**, we usually make **probabilistic causal claims**

### **probabilistic causal claims**

are claims that the presence of a cause $C$ makes an effect $E$ more or less likely to occur.

- In contrast to **deterministic causal claims** this implies
    - effect $E$ can happen when $C$ is absent
    - effect $E$ may not happen when $C$ is present
- **NOT** a claim that politics has some inherent randomness (not quantum mechanics)
    - recall, coin flips are **deterministic** but seem random.
    
## Probabilistic Causal Claims

If the social/political world is actually **deterministic**, why do we need **probabilistic claims**?

Because causality is complex and not fully known:

Cause $C$ might produce an effect $E$...

- only when multiple other necessary conditions are met (**conjunctural**)
- that differs depending on other factors $C_2$ etc. (**conjunctural**: conditional)
- in conjunction with **multiple** sets of necessary conditions (**multiple** and **conjunctural**)

$C$ appears to only cause a change in the **probability** or **likelihood** of seeing the effect $E$.


## Probabilistic Causal Claims

### Example:

Now we can say: "Wood construction causes buildings to be **more likely** to burn down."

- Wood framing might be **[N]ecessary** in many different conditions that are **[S]ufficient** for burning...
- But it is **[I]nsufficient** to produce this effect by itself. (E.g. depends on: gasoline+match, grease fire, lightning strike, absence of fire walls, absence of sprinklers)
- Other **necessary** conditions are only **sometimes** present

## Probabilistic Causal Claims

```{r,echo = F}

barplot(height = c(29.7, 31.5, 32.3, 34.5, 37.8),
        names.arg = c("Control", "Civic Duty", "Hawthorne", "Self\nVote Record", "Share\nVote Record"),
        ylab = "% Who Voted", ylim = c(0, 40), xlab = "Mailing Treatments",
        main = "An Experiment on Voter Turnout")
