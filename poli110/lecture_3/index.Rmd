# What is Science?

## Plan for Today

### 1) Recap Weber's insights

### 2) Attributes of scientific evidence

### 3) Example

### Open `menti.com`; wait for code

# Recap

# Scientific Evidence

## Two Key definitions

### **claim**: 

(For our purposes) a statement about what is true or valid. *If you can add "is true" to the end or "it is true that" to the beginning of the statement without changing the meaning, it is a claim.

### Don't overthink this definition. It is as simple as it seems.

## Two Key definitions

### **basis**: 

(For our purposes) the basis for a claim is the **reason we should accept the truth** or validity of that claim. It is the **evidence** that is used to "prove" the claim is true **and** the **assumptions** required for the evidence to be valid "proof" (sometimes called the "warrant")

## An example:

### **claim**: "It rained last night"

### **basis**: "The street is wet"

<br>

What is the evidence? What are the assumptions behind that evidence? 

#

## Using Science to Evaluate Claims

**Science** is distinct in 

#### (1) Only certain *claims* can be investigated

#### (2) Having special rules for using evidence and making assumptions to accept claims

# Scientific Evidence:

## Scientific Evidence:

### **Systematic use of evidence**

### **Transparent procedures**

### **Acknowledge uncertainty**

### **Test claim against alternatives**

## Transparent procedures 

### How did you arrive at your conclusion?

- What data / observations did you use?
- What comparisons did you make?
- What choices as a researcher did you make, and why

### Why?

- Others can know the assumptions required to find result
- Others can question your choices
- Others can replicate your work (objectivity)


## Consider alternatives 

### Test your claim against other competing claims

- Whichever claim "survives" many different tests is best

### Why?

- Openness to being wrong (no assumption above challenge)
- One piece of evidence can be consistent with many claims
- Best claim generates most useful predictions

## Systematic Use of Evidence 

### Observations we make:

- Clear rules for **what** we observe
- Clear rules for **how** we observe
- Clear rules for **comparison**
- Avoids "cherry-picking" 

### Why?

- Cherry picking assumes a truth, picks data
- Cherry picking doesn't consider alternatives
- Need to be able to consider challenge to our evidence

## Acknowledge uncertainty

### Limitations of finding:

- What questions remain unanswered after your study (what didn't it tell us)
- What assumptions did we make that might not be true?

### How certain or precise are our answers?

- Acknowledge possibility of chance relationships
- How confident can we be about our results being real?

# Example

## Consider a claim:

> **A person's prejudice against a group of people can be reduced through meaningful, interpersonal contact with a member of that group.**

## An investigation

### 2014 paper in *Science*: researchers conduct an experiment

<img src="./lacour_title.png" width = 100%>

## Prediction:

### Are efforts to **change the minds** of opponents same-sex marriage through conversation **more successful** when they are done by homoesexuals (compared to heterosexuals)?

<br>

**One hand = NO; Two hands = YES**

# Should we believe the results?

## To believe the results

### about **Transparent Procedures**?

#

## Treatments:

<img src="./lacour_3.png" height = 100%>

## Who was treated?

<img src="./lacour_2.png" height = 100%>

## How did they get treated?

## What were the survey questions?

### about **Systematic use of evidence**?

#

## Systematic use of evidence:

### What was the sample?

<img src="./lacour_8.png" width = 100%>

## Systematic use of evidence:

### What were the comparisons?

<img src="./lacour_9.png" width = 100%>

## To believe the results

What do you need to know...

### about **Considering Alternatives**?

#

## Consider alternatives:

### Could it be that effect is from having someone come to the door?

- Not the content or the contact, simply being canvassed

## Consider alternatives:

### What if gay canvassers are different that straight in other ways?

- Might be better able to articulate issue
- Might be more motivated, so more persuasive
- Might be different in other ways that make them persuasive

## To believe the results

What do you need to know...

### about **Acknowledging Uncertainty**?

#

## Uncertainty

### Statistical uncertainty
### Uncertainty in conclusions

## Results have confidence intervals

<img src="./lacour_11.png" width = 100%>

## Results leave questions

### **Why were indirect effects larger for gay canvassers?**

<br>

### **Would this work for other identity groups?**

## Results:

### **Canvassing for gay marriage (compared to recycling) reduced prejudice**

<br> 

### **Reductions in prejudice larger and last longer with homosexual canvassers**

# Do you believe these results?

## Conclusion:

### <u>**Transparent procedures**</u>

### **Systematic use of evidence**

### **Acknowledge uncertainty**

### **Test claim against alternatives**
