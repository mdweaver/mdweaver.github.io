## Incendiary Speech and Violence

Did Trump rallies cause an increase in hate crime?

> "A USA TODAY analysis of the 64 rallies Trump ... held [between] 2017 [and 2019] found that, when discussing immigration, the president has said 'invasion' at least 19 times. He has used the word 'animal' 34 times and the word 'killer' nearly three dozen times."

Rallies caused hate crimes?

## Solutions to Confounding

Must ask...

- What **comparisons** between cases does it involve?
    - can you **recognize** this solution when it is described to you?
    - can you **describe** how to use this solution to test a particular causal claim?
- What **assumptions** are required for it to work?
- *How* does it "solve" confounding?
- What **trade offs** do we make?

---

**Internal Validity**: is the extent to which the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ found in a research design is the true causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ (*does not suffer from confounding*). 

- studies with strong internal validity: we have very good reason to believe that the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ actually implies the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ *for the cases we observe*.
- **because** we can easily believe/check the assumptions

---

**External Validity**: is the extent to which the *causal relationship* we find *in a study* is relevant to the causal relationship in our causal question/claim

- Study has external validity if it examines causal relationship for **the cases we are interested in**

    - if study has sampling bias (sample in study different from population of interest), may lack external validity

- Study has external validity if the causal variable in the study **maps onto the concept/definition of the cause** in the causal claim.
    
    - if the $X$ that is used in the study doesn't align with the causal claim, may lack external validity


## Always a Trade-off

But the choice of "solution" to confounding — or our **research design** — always involves a trade off:

Increasing confidence that correlation yields an **unbiased** estimate of the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ (**internal validity**)...

...comes at the cost of limiting the cases we can examine and causal variables we can examine (**external validity**)




## Incendiary Speech and Violence

One way to solve confounding is to do an **experiment**: 

[Kalmoe (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2013.852642) examines the effect of "aggressive" and "violent" language on **support** for political violence. 

- 512 survey respondents in random sample of US adults were **randomly assigned** to see two versions of campaign ad
- one used more aggressive words like "fight", the other less aggressive words.
- people report their support for violence on survey questions

---

**Treatment vs Control**

<img src="./kalmoe_1.png">

Why do both groups receive campaign ad text?

>- Exclusion restriction: only changing "aggressive language" ($X$)

---

**Outcomes**

<img src="./kalmoe_2.png">


## Incendiary Speech and Violence


[Kalmoe (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2013.852642) finds that "aggressive" and "violent" language **increased** support for political violence.

- survey respondents were **randomly assigned** to see two versions of campaign ad
- one used more aggressive words like "fight", the other less aggressive words.
- people report their support for violence

>- do you believe the 'violent' ads **caused** people to support violence?
>- can this tell us about possible effects of Trump's speeches on violence?

# Interlude

Before we return to speech and hate crimes

## Imagine...

You live in mid-19th century London. 

- Every few years, hundreds to thousands of people are killed in cholera outbreaks
- To stop these deaths, you need to answer:

> What causes the spread of **cholera**?


## Cholera

Dominant view was that "miasmas" or "bad air" caused diseases like cholera

## Broad Street Pump Outbreak (1854)

John Snow, MD suggested cholera transmitted as "germ" in water.

To provide evidence of his claim, Snow uses **correlation**: mapped cholera deaths of 1854 outbreak in SoHo.

- Broad Street Pump (source of drinking water) had "fouled" water (X)
- Examined mortality from cholera (Y)
- Proximity to the Broad Street Pump (C) correlated with mortality (Y)
- Proximity to **other** pumps not related to mortality

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F, out.width="100%"}

  ylab("Number of Deaths") + 
  ggtitle("Street Distance to Broad St. Pump and Cholera Deaths: London 1854")
```

>- positive correlation (closer to pump $\to$ more cholera)

## Broad Street Pump Outbreak (1854)

Leading doctors rejected Snow's evidence:

- Houses near Broad Street Pump built on 1665 plague burial site. 
- Sewers produce foul odors from rotting material/human waste

Both might produce miasmas.

- maybe Plague cemetery/Sewer $\to$ Miasmas $\to$ Foul Water
- and  Miasmas $\to$ Cholera

<br>

>- So... Confounding.

## Broad Street Pump Outbreak (1854)

Snow's solution to confounding: compare people "near pump" w/ different water sources

|  | **Brewers** | **Broad St. Residents** |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Water Source (X)** | **Brewery Well**/<br>**Beer** (Clean) | **Pump** (Contam.)|
| **Location** | Near pump | Near pump |
| **Timing** |  Aug. 1854 |  Aug. 1854 |
| **Miasmas (W)** | Yes | Yes |
| **Cholera (Y)** | **No** | **Yes** |

## Broad Street Pump Outbreak (1854)

Snow's solution to confounding: compare people "far from pump" w/ different water sources

|  | **Lady and Niece** | **West End Residents** |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Water Source (X)** | **Broad Street Pump**<br>(Contam.) | **Another Pump**<br>(Clean) |
| **Location** | Mile from Broad St. | Mile from Broad St. |
| **Timing** |  Aug. 1854 |  Aug. 1854 |
| **Miasmas (W)** | No | No |
| **Cholera (Y)** | **Yes** | **No** |


## Broad Street Pump Outbreak (1854)

Discuss:

**do you find these comparisons more convincing than the simple correlation?**

**Why or why not?**

## Holding geography constant

```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
dagify(cholera ~ water,
       water ~ miasma,

                                    angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(c(1,-1,1,-1,-1,1),'lines'),
                                    edge_linetype = rep(c(2,2,2,2,1,1), each = 100),

```

## Conditioning: What is it?

### **conditioning**

we observe $X$ and $Y$ for multiple cases, we examine the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ *within* groups of cases that are **the same**$^*$ on confounding variables $W, etc. \ldots$

*How* does conditioning solve the problem? 

- Cases compared have **same values** on confounding variable $W$ ("holding $W$ constant")
- In these groups, $W$ cannot affect $X$ or $Y$ (because $W$ is not moving, it can't move $X$ or $Y$)
- "Backdoor" path from $X$ to $Y$ is "blocked"

## Conditioning

In contrast to experiments, conditioning is possible for **any cases** and **for any possible-cause $X$**:

Conditioning has greater **external validity**.

- can observe any cases that we can measure
- can look at any causal variable that we can measure


# Conditioning, an Example

Correlation between Trump Rallies and Hate Crimes likely suffers from confounding

Possible confounders imagined by [Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf)

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}

       exposure = "rally", 
       outcome = 'hate_crime',
       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",

                  'hate_group' = '# Hate\nGroups',

## Example: Conditioning:

[Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf) compare hate crimes in counties with and without Trump rallies, but condition on (hold constant$^*$):

- percent Jewish
- number of hate groups
- crime rate
- 2012 Republican vote share
- percent university educated
- region

## Example: Conditioning

- Lots of news headlines [like this](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/24/18279807/trump-hate-crimes-study-white-nationalism)

| Solution | How Confounding<br>Solved | Which Confounding<br>Removed | Assumes | Internal<br>Validity | External<br>Validity |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Experiment | Randomization<br>Breaks $W \rightarrow X$ link | **All** confounding variables | $X$ is random;<br> Change only $X$ | High | Low | 
| Conditioning | Hold confounders<br>constant | ? | ? | ? | High |


## Conclusion

**Conditioning**

- What is it?: Look at correlation between $X$ and $Y$, for cases with same value of $W$
- How does it solve confounding?: $W$ held constant, so correlation between $X$, $Y$ cannot be due to $\uparrow \downarrow W$ 
- What are the assumptions?: That is a *very good question* for next week
