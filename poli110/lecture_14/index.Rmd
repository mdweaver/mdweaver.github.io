# Recap

## Causality is Counterfactual

All causal claims are claims about how the world would be changed in an *alternate timeline* in which some thing (or things) were different than they actually are. 

These alternate timelines/universes are **counterfactuals**

## Causality is Counterfactual

> "The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe caused Russia to invade Ukraine"

implicitly claims that...

in the **counterfactual** world where NATO did not expand (the "cause" is not present), Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in February 2022 (the "effect" would be different).

## Potential Outcomes Describe Counterfactuals

**potential outcomes** are values for variables that describe the factual world (that has occurred) and counterfactual worlds (that have not). 

-  a variable corresponding to what is "affected" or the "outcome" (e.g. Russia invasion: yes or no)
-  the **values** that variable would take **for a particular case** (e.g. Ukraine) in different "universes" where the variable for the "cause" (e.g. # of E. European countries in NATO) were to take different values

$\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 0) = ?$
$\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 14) = ?$

## Potential Outcomes

Which of these potential outcomes is **factual**? **Counterfactual**?

$\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 0) = ?$
$\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 14) = ?$

What are the values of these potential outcomes if the following claim is true?

> "The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe caused Russia to invade Ukraine"

## Causality is Counterfactual

> "The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe caused Russia to invade Ukraine"

If this causal claim were true: then it implies these potential outcomes:

$\color{red}{\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 0) = \mathrm{No}}$
$\mathrm{Russian \ Invasion}_{Ukr}(\mathrm{E. \ Europ. \ NATO \ Memb.} = 14) = \mathrm{Yes}$

(red indicates $\color{red}{\mathrm{counterfactual}}$)

## Counterfactual Claims:

It follows that, all causal claims can be re-stated as **counterfactual claims**

- They contain a **conditional clause**, starting with "If" (always in the **subjunctive mood**)
- A "then" clause, stating what would happen if the **conditional**/**"If"** clause were true (always in the **conditional mood**)
- May be in past, present, or future tense.

## Counterfactual Claims:

### Example:

"BC's mask mandate reduced COVID fatalities."

$$\underbrace{If \ \  BC \ \ had \ \ not \ \ imposed \ \ a \ \ mask \ \ mandate}_{\text{If-clause in Subjunctive Mood}}, \\
\underbrace{there \ \ would \ \  have \ \ been \ \ more \ \ COVID \ \ deaths.}_{\text{Then-clause in Conditional Mood}}$$


## Counterfactual Claims:

Note: **Counterfactual claims get increasingly complicated, the more complicated your causal claim is**

- On assignments, exam do not come up with overly complex causal claims.

## Practice:

Turn to your neighbors: turn these causal claims into counterfactual claims.

1. "Russia's failure to quickly defeat the Ukrainian Army led it to shell and bomb civilian areas." (left side)
2. "Ownership of rental housing by large investment firms has increased the cost of rent." (center)
3. "Lifting of vaccine passport requirements decreased Canadians' uptake of COVID vaccine booster shots." (right side)


# Varieties of Causal Claims

## Two ways of asking causal questions

Usually... different kinds of causal questions are answered with **different kinds of causal claims**

1. **causes of effects** $\to$ **deterministic** causal claims
2. **effects of causes** $\to$ **probabilistic** causal claims

## Deterministic Causal Claims

**deterministic causal claims**

claims about what happens with **certainty** under specific causal conditions

- whenever some **cause** (or set of causes) is present, the **effect** <u>**always**</u> happens
- or whenever some **cause** (or set of causes) is absent, the **effect** <u>**never**</u> happens
- usually make these claims when we are interested in **causes of effects**

## Deterministic Causal Claims

There are several varieties **and** combinations

- **necessary** conditions
- **sufficient** conditions
- conjunctural/multiple causation (combinations of multiple necessary/sufficiency conditions)

## Necessary Conditions

### **necessary conditions**

A causal claim that there is some cause $C$ **without which** the effect $E$ **cannot occur**

- A cause $C$ **must happen** in order for effect $E$ to happen.
- **Does not mean** if the cause $C$ is present, effect $E$ must happen

## Necessary Conditions: Example

A claim: "Without the weak response by NATO and other European states to the Russian annexation of Crimea, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine."

Also can be stated: "The weak reponse by NATO and other European states to the Russian annexation of Crimea was a necessary condition for the invasion of Ukraine."

## Necessary Conditions: Example

If this claim is true: "The weak reponse by NATO and other European states to the Russian annexation of Crimea was a necessary condition for the invasion of Ukraine."...

The fact that Russia suffered minimal sanctions after the annexation **does not mean** that the invasion of Ukrain was inveitable. 

>- Presence of necessary condition $\not\to$ effect must happen. Instead, *absence* of necessary condition $\to$ effect does not happen

## Sufficient Conditions

(In contrast to **necessary conditions**)

### **sufficient conditions**

- cause $C$ **always** produces an effect $E$ when it is present
- do not depend on other factors being present; cause $C$ can produce $E$ **by itself**
- Sufficient conditions imply: every time $C$ is present, then $E$ will happen 

## Sufficient Conditions: Example

**"A military coup that overthrows a democratically elected government is a sufficient condition for large public protests."**

- This *might* be the case every time
- Does not appear to depend on other factors

#### Generally, single causes that are sufficient conditions are **rare** in social sciences


## Voting Experiment

### **Why do people vote?**

>- People may vote because of social pressure to do "the right thing"
>- Does threatening to publicly release peoples' voting history (shaming them) lead them to vote?

dd = data.frame(h = c(29.7, 31.5, 34.5, 37.8),
                cond = factor(c("Control", "Civic Duty", "Self\nVote Record", "Share\nVote Record"), levels = c("Control", "Civic Duty", "Self\nVote Record", "Share\nVote Record"))
)
                
ggplot(dd, aes(x = cond, y = h)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ylab("% Who Voted") + xlab("Mailing Treatments") + ggtitle("Voter Turnout by Experimental Group") + theme_bw()

## Complex Causality

Does it make sense to say that "being shamed" is a **necessary condition** for voting?

>- No. Clearly some people voted in absence of shaming

Does it make sense to say that "being shamed" is a **sufficient condition** for voting?

>- No. Some people were shamed but did not vote.

>- It is simpler to state this probabilistically: being shamed increases likelihood of voting.


## Probabilistic Causal Claims

### **probabilistic causal claims**

are claims that the presence/absence of a cause $C$ makes an effect $E$ more or less likely to occur. Or cause $C$ increases/decreases effect $E$ **on average**

- In contrast to **deterministic causal claims** this implies
    - effect $E$ can happen when $C$ is absent
    - effect $E$ may not happen when $C$ is present
- **NOT** a claim that politics has some inherent randomness (e.g. quantum mechanics)
- Usually make these claims when interested in **effects of causes**


## Complex Causality

Causality may be **deterministic**... there are exact conditions for when effect always/never happens.

But in reality, it is almost always **complex** 

- **multiple** factors might be necessary (conjunctural causality)
- different causes produce same effect (multiple causality)
- different groups of factors might, together be sufficient (multiple and conjunctural)
- (INUS/SUIN conditions: [see here](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12340))

## Probabilistic Causal Claims

Because causality is complex, we do not fully know deterministic rules...

$C$ appears to only cause a change in the **probability** or **likelihood** of seeing the effect $E$.

- e.g. [coin flips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYnJv68T3MM)

## Probabilistic Claims

Which are probabilistic causal claims?

#### **A) It's probably true that leftwing government reduce student tuition fees**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **B) Electing a leftwing, rather than rightwing, government increases the likelihood that tuition fees wil be reduced**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **C) Tuition fees are reduced more frequently under leftwing governments than rightwing governments**


## Examples

Which is a probabilistic causal claim?

#### ~~**A) It's probably true that leftwing government reduce student tuition fees**~~

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **B) Electing a leftwing, rather than rightwing, government increases the likelihood that tuition fees wil be reduced**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### ~~**C)  Tuition fees are reduced more frequently under leftwing governments than rightwing governments**~~
    
## Recognizing probabilistic causal claims

Not every probabilistic statement is **causal**

#### 1. ~~"Oppression is likely to cause a rebellion"~~

- Says oppression is probably a cause out rebellion
- Should say: cause $C$ **changes likelihood** of outcome $E$

#### 2. ~~"Rebellions are more likely to occur in places where the population is oppressed"~~

- Says we are more likely to **see** rebellion where population is oppressed
- Not clearly **causal**; just a descriptive claim.

# Evidence for Causal Claims

## Evidence for Causal Claims

We focus on how to provide evidence that answers questions about **effects of causes** rather than **causes of effects**.

- easier to address **effects of causes**
- both are **incredibly difficult**

## Evidence for Causal Claims

A claim for today:

> BC's face-mask mandate reduced COVID mortality in the province over the course of the pandemic.

- restate this as a **counterfactual claim**
- what kind of **empirical** evidence would help you decide whether this claim is true?

## Evidence for Causal Claims

 **Causal claims** imply relationships between **potential outcomes**
 
$\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}) <$  $\color{red}{\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{No \ Mask \ Mandate})}$:

$\mathrm{Black}$ indicates **factual** potential outcomes (we observe this state of the world)

$\color{red}{\mathrm{Red}}$ indicates **counter**factual potential outcomes (we do not observe this state of the world)

## Evidence for Causal Claims

$\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}) = 2,929$

>- I checked the [BC CDC Covid Dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a6f23959a8b14bfa989e3cda29297ded)

$\color{red}{\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{No \ Mask \ Mandate})} = \ ?$:

>- How could we know what this is?
>- We can **never know** what deaths in BC would be absent the mask mandate.

## What is the problem here?

### **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

1. For BC, we can **only** observe the potential outcome of $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}$ for where the value of $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate} = Yes$: the **actual policy** in BC.

2. We can **never observe** the other, **counterfactual**, potential outcomes of $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}$ where $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate} = No$, because that is not the actual policy.

3. We can never **empirically** observe, for British Columbia, whether $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}$ causes $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}$.

## What is the problem here?

### **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

1. By definition, $X$ causes $Y$ if the value of $Y$ were different if we changed $X$ for the exact same case.

2. For a specific case, we can **only** observe the potential outcome of $Y$ for the value of $X$ it **actually takes**. 

3. We **never observe** the **counterfactual** potential outcomes of $Y$ for different possible values of $X$ that the case did not experience.

4. We can never **empirically** observe, for a specific case, whether $X$ causes $Y$.

# That's depressing
