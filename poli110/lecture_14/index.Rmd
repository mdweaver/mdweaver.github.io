# Recap

## Poll


## Complex Causality

Causality may be **deterministic**... there are exact conditions for when effect always/never happens.

But in reality, it is almost always **complex** 

- multiple, conjunctural, multiple AND conjunctural
- (INUS/SUIN conditions: [see here](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12340))

## Voting Experiment

### **Why do people vote?**

>- Lot's of causal forces determine whether you vote

dd = data.frame(h = c(29.7, 31.5, 34.5, 37.8),
                cond = factor(c("Control", "Civic Duty", "Self\nVote Record", "Share\nVote Record"), levels = c("Control", "Civic Duty", "Self\nVote Record", "Share\nVote Record"))
)
                
ggplot(dd, aes(x = cond, y = h)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ylab("% Who Voted") + xlab("Mailing Treatments") + ggtitle("Voter Turnout by Experimental Group") + theme_bw()

## Complex Causality

Does it make sense to say that "being shamed" is a **necessary condition** for voting?

>- No. Clearly some people voted in absence of shaming

Does it make sense to say that "being shamed" is a **sufficient condition** for voting?

>- No. Some people were shamed but did not vote.

## Deterministic Causal Claims?

We are often unable to **fully describe** deterministic rules for what causes produce an effect

>- It is straightforward to state causal claims probabilistically: being shamed increases likelihood of voting.


## Probabilistic Causal Claims

### **probabilistic causal claims**

are claims that the presence/absence of a cause $C$ makes an effect $E$ more or less likely to occur. Or cause $C$ increases/decreases effect $E$ **on average**

- In contrast to **deterministic causal claims** this implies
    - effect $E$ can happen when $C$ is absent
    - effect $E$ may not happen when $C$ is present
- **NOT** a claim that politics has some inherent randomness (e.g. quantum mechanics)
- Usually make these claims when interested in **effects of causes**

## Probabilistic Causal Claims

### Why do we need **probabilistic claims**?

Causality is deterministic. 

But causality is also complex, and not fully known:

Cause $C$ might produce an effect $E$...

- only when multiple other necessary conditions are met (**conjunctural**)
- as only one of  **multiple** sufficient causes of the effect (**multiple**)
- in multiple conjunctural conditions.

$C$ appears to only cause a change in the **probability** or **likelihood** of seeing the effect $E$.

## Probabilistic Claims

Which are probabilistic causal claims?

#### **A) It's probably true that leftwing government reduce student tuition fees**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **B) Electing a leftwing, rather than rightwing, government increases the likelihood that tuition fees wil be reduced**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **C) Tuition fees are reduced more frequently under leftwing governments than rightwing governments**

## Examples

Which is a probabilistic causal claim?

#### ~~**A) It's probably true that leftwing government reduce student tuition fees**~~

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### **B) Electing a leftwing, rather than rightwing, government increases the likelihood that tuition fees wil be reduced**

<hr style="height:8px; visibility:hidden;" />

#### ~~**C)  Tuition fees are reduced more frequently under leftwing governments than rightwing governments**~~
    
## Recognizing probabilistic causal claims

Not every probabilistic statement is **causal**

#### 1. ~~"Oppression is likely to cause a rebellion"~~

- Says oppression is probably a cause out rebellion
- Should say: cause $C$ **changes likelihood** of outcome $E$

#### 2. ~~"A rebellion is more likely to occur when the population is oppressed"~~

- Says we are more likely to **see** rebellion where population is oppressed
- Not clearly **causal**; just a descriptive claim.


# Evidence for Causal Claims

## Evidence for Causal Claims

We focus on how to provide evidence for **probabilistic causal claims**.

- easier to do than supporting **deterministic** causal claims
- still **really hard**

## Evidence for Causal Claims

A claim for today:

> BC's face-mask mandate reduced COVID transmission and mortality in the province over the course of the pandemic.

In groups:

- restate this as a **counterfactual claim**
- what kind of **empirical** evidence would help you decide whether this claim is true?

## Evidence for Causal Claims

 **Causal claims** imply relationships between **potential outcomes**
 
$\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}) <$  $\color{red}{\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{No \ Mask \ Mandate})}$:

$\mathrm{Black}$ indicates **factual** potential outcomes (we observe this state of the world)

$\color{red}{\mathrm{Red}}$ indicates **counter**factual potential outcomes (we do not observe this state of the world)

## Evidence for Causal Claims

$\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}) = 1,394$

>- I checked the [BC CDC Covid Dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a6f23959a8b14bfa989e3cda29297ded)

$\color{red}{\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}(\mathrm{No \ Mask \ Mandate})} = \ ?$:

>- How could we know what this is?
>- We can **never know** what deaths in BC would be absent the mask mandate.



## What is the problem here?

### **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

1. For BC, we can **only** observe the potential outcome of $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}$ for where the value of $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate} = Yes$: the **actual policy** in BC.

2. We can **never observe** the other, **counterfactual**, potential outcomes of $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}_{BC}$ where $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate} = No$, because that is not the actual policy.

3. We can never **empirically** observe, for British Columbia, whether $\mathrm{Mask \ Mandate}$ causes $\mathrm{COVID \ Deaths}$.

## What is the problem here?

### **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

1. By definition, $X$ causes $Y$ if $Y$ would be different if $X$ were different, for the exact same case.

2. For a specific case, we can **only** observe the potential outcome of $Y$ for the value of $X$ that the case is actually exposed to. 

3. We can **never observe** the other, **counterfactual**, potential outcomes of $Y$ for different possible values of $X$ that the case did not experience.

4. We can never **empirically** observe, for a specific case, whether $X$ causes $Y$.

## Is there a solution?

We'll examine the options
