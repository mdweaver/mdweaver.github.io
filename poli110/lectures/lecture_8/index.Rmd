# Concepts

## From Theory to Empirics {.build}

### Until now:

Posing questions, making claims

### Now

Answering questions, evaluating claims


## From Theory to Empirics

### What is the first step?

## Some claims: {.build}

The election of ethnic political parties cause an increase in ethnic violence.

Democratic governments improve the health of their citizens.

Technologies that favor offensive over defensive warfare make war more likely to occur.

Introducing proportional representation causes a decline in the accountability of legislators.

## Before we evalute these claims

### What are the first things we need to know?

## Before we evalute these claims

The election of **ethnic political parties** cause an increase in **ethnic violence**.

### What are...

- ethnic political parties?
- ethnic violence?

What do these mean? How would we recognize them?

## Before we evalute these claims

**Democratic** governments improve the **health of their citizens**.

### What are...

- democracies?
- health?

What do these mean? How would we recognize them?

## Before we evalute these claims

Technologies that favor **offensive** over **defensive** warfare make **war** more likely to occur.

### What are...

- Offensive technologies?
- Defensive technologies?
- Wars?

What do these mean? How would we recognize them?


## Before we evalute these claims

Introducing **proportional representation** causes a decline in the **accountability** of legislators.

### What is

- Proportional representation?
- Accountability?

What do these mean? How would we recognize them?

## What we need:

**Concepts**: abstract definitions that are used to describe phenomena, groups, individuals, and their attributes.

- Help us clarify what causal or descriptive claims mean.


## Concepts:

### More attributes

- **General**, not specific
    - no proper nouns
    
## Concepts:

Aren't these really easy?

## Concepts:

What is a ...

### Democracy

## Concepts:

What is a ...

### War

## A procedure:

1. List all cases where concept clearly applies...
    - E.g., everyone would agree that Canada is a democracy
2. Propose a "covering definition".
    - A definition that would apply concept to all clear cases
3. Does this definition include other cases that intuitively do not belong
    - This includes both actual or hypothetical cases
4. Go back to 2, reformulate definition
    - avoid many of conditions using "or", add criteria to fit a sintle idiosyncratic case

## A procedure:

Repeat 3 and 4 until:

- No more exceptions you can think of
- Remaining exceptions are borderline cases where no one has a strong intuition on whether they fit the category

## An example: "Ethnic violence"

### 1. What are the "clear" cases?

>- Holocaust, Rwandan Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing in Balkans, KKK attacks against African Americans


## An example: "Ethnic violence" {.build}

### 2. A "covering" definition?

>- "ethnic violence is violence between ethnic groups"

## An example: "Ethnic violence" {.build}

"ethnic violence is violence between ethnic groups"

### 3. Are there exceptions to this rule?

>- white American mugged by an African American?
>- fight between fans of Brazil and Argentina national football teams?

### Fit the rule, but are they "ethnic violence"

- Is mugging "economic crime" rather than "hate crime"?


## An example: "Ethnic violence"

- Are attacks on an ethnic group to take their land, jobs, material goods "ethnic violence" in absence of "hatred"?
- What if soldier from separatist armed group plants a bomb that kills many from a different ethnic group. Soldier may lack hatred, does it count?
- Could mugging be ethnic violence if ethnicity of victim is pretext for theft?
- Can wars between countries be "ethnic violence"?

## An example: "Ethnic violence"

### Refined definition:

Violence is "ethnic" if it involves members of different ethnic groups and either:

1. it is motivated by hatred or dislike of ethnic others;

2. The criterion for selecting victims is ethnicity;

3. it is committed on behalf of in in the name of an ethnic group, or against those claiming to represent an ethnic group (and because of that)

and at least one of the actors is not a state.


## Another concept: "natural amenities"

In the 1990s, the US government sought to evaluate the best and worst places in American with respect to the natural scenery and climate.

**natural amenities**: "physical characteristics of an area that enhance the location as a place to live"

## Natural amenities

<img src='./amenities_map.jpg' width=100%>

## Natural amenities

Vancouver would probably rank "very high" on natural amenities. 

### But

Just what physical characteristics "enhance a location as a place to live"?

## Natural amenities

Several dimensions of "natural amenities"

### According to the US Department of Agriculture:

- Warm winters
- Winter sunlight
- Temperate summer
- Low summer humidity
- Topographic variation
- Surface water

## Dimensions of a concept: {.build}

**dimensions of a concept**: phenomena that both:

1. Are **part** of the concept

2. Could exist, disappear, change **independently** of one another. They are **not redundant**

### Dimensions are like "sub-concepts"

### Why do dimensions matter?

- Clarify causal logics
- Moving from concept to measurement

## Example: Multiculturalism and conflict

claim:

### "**Multicultural policy** reduces **ethnic conflict**"

## Multicultural policy:

Defining the concept:

> "Forms of public recognition, support, or accommodation for ethnocultural minorities to maintain and express their distinct identities and practices."

## Multicultural policy:

A multidimensional concept (for immigrant minorities):

- **Formal state commitment** to MCP:
- Multiculturalism in **school curricula**
- Required diversity in **media**
- Exemptions from **dress codes**
- Permitting **dual citizenship**
- **Funding ethnic groups/organizations**
- **Funding** bilingual/mother-tongue instruction
- **Affirmative action** for disadvantaged minorities

## Multicultural policy:

<img src='./mcp_index.gif' width=100%>

## Multicultural policy:

Does it matter **which** dimensions are present and absent?

- Different dimensions may have different **effects**
- Should inform our theory, causal logics
- Conversely, need to **measure** correct dimension of concept as it corresponds to theory

# From Concepts to Measurement

## Once we have concepts... {.build}

### What do we do?

- Identify **variables**
- Propose **measures**
