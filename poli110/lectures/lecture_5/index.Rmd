# Causal Claims

## Why causation? {.build}

### Prescription *requires* answers to *causal* questions

- not always easy/possible to answer

### **Prediction** requires causal knowledge


### Without prediction, without causes, there is no understanding
    
- Need to know **why** things happen


## Causal questions in politics: {.build}

### 1. Effects of policies and institutions

- Helps answer: which policies or institutions should we adopt/change

### 2. Causes of policy and political actions

- Why do governments/political actors make the choices they do?
- Why do political actors/institutions often **fail** to meet our prescriptive ideals?
- Why do political outcomes vary so widely?

## Causal questions in politics: {.build}

### 3. Causes of *inputs* into political choices

- What causes some actors to be more powerful than others
- Why do political actors **want** certain things?


## Causal claims {.build}

### 1. The U.S. invasion of Iraq *caused* the creation of ISIS

### 2. Sexism in the United States *caused* the victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton

### 3. The threat of nuclear war **caused** the United States and Soviet Union to avoid going to war.

## Counterfactuals: {.build}

### The U.S. invasion of Iraq *caused* the creation of ISIS

- **If** the US **did not invade** Iraq, ISIS **would not** have been created

### Sexism in the United States *caused* the victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton

- **If** there were **less sexism** in the US, then Trump **would not** have won.

### The threat of nuclear war **caused** the United States and Soviet Union to avoid going to war.

- **If** nuclear weapons **had not** existed, the US and USSR would have gone to war.

## Counterfactuals: {.build}

Causality **requires** a counterfactual claim.

### Definition

"C is a cause of E" **necessarily implies**:

#### If C had not happened, E would not have happened

### What is one causal claim

### Restate as counterfactual

## Counterfactuals: {.build}

### What is the object of a counterfactual claim?

It is a claim about the **same** thing, person, country, world **but**

with a **different** exposure to the supposed **cause**

### It compares the same thing/unit to itself, not to something else

### Everything is the same **except** the **cause**

## Counterfactuals and potential outcomes:

### Potential outcomes:

- The state of a unit/person/country/world under different exposures, whether factual or counterfactual

### Example:

1. If the United States had invaded Iraq, then ISIS would have been created
2. If the United states had not invaded Iraq, then ISIS would not have been created

## Counterfactuals and potential outcomes:

A potential outcomes table

```{r}

data.frame(Unit = 'The world',
 Invasion = c("?"),
 `ISIS if invade` = c('Yes'),
 `ISIS if not invade`= c('No'),
 ISIS = c("?")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)

```

## Counterfactuals and potential outcomes: 

What if we could look at multiple universes?

```{r}

data.frame(
 Universe = 1:2,
 Invasion = c("Yes", "No"),
 `ISIS if invade` = c('Yes', 'Yes'),
 `ISIS if not invade`= c('No', 'No'),
 ISIS = c("Yes", "No")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)

```

## Counterfactuals and potential outcomes: 

More generally: 

```{r}
data.frame(
 Universe = c("Factual", "Counterfactual"),
 C = c("Yes", "No"),
 `E if C` = c('Yes', 'Yes'),
 `E if not C`= c('No', 'No'),
 E = c("Yes", "No")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)
```

## Counterfactuals: 

What we actually see:

```{r}
data.frame(
 Universe = c("Factual", "Counterfactual"),
 Invasion = c("Yes", "No"),
 `ISIS if invade` = c('Yes', '?'),
 `ISIS if not invade`= c('?', '?'),
 ISIS = c("Yes", "?")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)
```

## Counterfactuals:

### Recall:

Causal claims imply descriptive claims.

What descriptive claims are implied here?

### Sexism in the United States *caused* the victory of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton

- **If** there were **less sexism** in the US, then Trump **would not** have won.

## Counterfactuals:

```{r}
data.frame(
 Universe = c("Factual", "Counterfactual"),
 Sexism = c("Yes", "No"),
 `Trump if sexism` = c('Yes', 'Yes'),
 `Trump if not sexism`= c('No', 'No'),
 Trump = c("Yes", "No")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)
```

## Counterfactuals: {.build}

### What if the two universes were different in more than one way?

```{r}
data.frame(
 Universe = c(1:2),
 Sexism = c("Yes", "No"),
 Racism = c("Yes", "No"),
 `Trump if sexism` = c('Yes', '**No**'),
 `Trump if not sexism`= c('**Yes**', 'No'),
 Trump = c("Yes", "No")
) %>% kable(., format = 'pandoc', padding=3) # %>%  kable_styling(., bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed"), full_width = T)
```

## Counterfactual trouble: {.build}

### - We can only observe the world in one state, not both

### - We only observe history once, can't rerun it.

### - "Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference"

# Types of causes

## First World War: {.build}

### World historical event

- War between all great powers

- Decline or dissolution of empires

- Emergence of Communism

- United States becomes dominant


### Horrific human cost:

- ~ 9 million combat deaths; ~ 8 million civilian deaths

- Set in motion Second World War

### What was the cause?

## *Structural* causes

1. Ethno-national tensions within Austria-Hungary

2. Imperialism / competition over resources

3. Militarism and aggressive aims

4. Structure of alliances

## "Triggering Event"? {.build}

### Was assassination the cause?

### Was Russian mobilization the cause?

### Would war have happened anyway?


## The Arab Spring {.build}

### The cause.

- Mohamed Bouazizi, Tunisian peddler self immolates

- His death sparks popular anger, massive protest

- One month later, Tunisian government (under Ben Ali) falls

- Protest sweeps the region

### The cause?

## Cause of Tunisian regime change {.build}

### Bouazizi's death $\xrightarrow{\text{protest}}$ Regime collapse

### What, if anything, would you add to this explanation?

## Cause of Tunisian regime change {.build}

### Oppressive Rule

### $\xrightarrow{\text{hopelessness/anger}}$ 

### Bouazizi's death

### $\xrightarrow{\text{protest}}$ 

### Regime collapse

## Cause of Tunisian regime change

### Consider the counter-factual...

- Could protest and regime collapse have happened even if Bouazizi had not died?

- Maybe oppressive rule made lots of people angry, ready to protest



## Cause of Tunisian regime change {.build}

### Oppressive Rule

### $\xrightarrow{\text{hopelessness/anger}}$ 

### Someone starts hunger strike

### $\xrightarrow{\text{protest}}$ 

### Regime collapse

## Cause of Tunisian regime change

### Oppressive Rule

### $\xrightarrow{\text{hopelessness/anger}}$ 

### Someone else self-immolates

### $\xrightarrow{\text{protest}}$ 

### Regime collapse

## Cause of Tunisian regime change

### Oppressive Rule (*structural cause*)

### $\xrightarrow{\text{hopelessness/anger}}$ 

### Bouazizi's death (*triggering event*)

### $\xrightarrow{\text{protest}}$ 

### Regime collapse

## Structural causes vs. triggering event

### Triggering event:

- Details **how or when** some outcome/event happens

- **Fails** to meet **counterfactual** definition of a cause
    - triggers are **substitutable**
    - **Some** trigger necessary, but **specific** trigger is not

## Structural causes vs. triggering event
    
### Recognizing triggering events:

**Triggering event** is event that:

- Generates outocome **only in combination** with structural causes
    - is not sufficient

- Could have been **substituted** by other events that were also likely
    - is not necessary
    
## Identify the triggering event: {.build}

### Global Financial Crisis of 2008

1. Inequality

2. Weak regulatory structures

3. Collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank


### Riots in Ferguson, Missouri: 2014

1. Failure of Grand Jury to indict police officer who shot Mike Brown

2. Systemic racial bias in police stops

3. Ferguson city reliance on tickets and fines for revenue

## Structural causes

Social science interested in **structural causes** 

Want causal **patterns/regularities**

### Why?

1. What conditions **generally** necessary for an outcome
    - Revolutions don't generally **require** Mohamed Bouazizi
2. What conditions **generally** contribute to outcomes
    - Self-immolation of peddlers does not **typically** lead to revolution
