# Types of Claims

## Last week {.build}

### What are claims?

### What are bases for claims?

- scientific 
- unscientific

## This week {.build}

### What kinds of questions are there?

### What kinds of claims (answers) are there?

### How to tell them apart?

### Which are answerable?

#

## Some questions: {.build}

### - How many firearms homicides took place in the U.S. and Canada in 2016?

### -What percentage of income is earned by the richest 1% of Canadians?

### - What percentage of Canadians use cannabis recreationally?

# What kinds of questions are these?

## Some claims {.build}

### - Canada had 223 and the US had 11004 firearms homicides in 2016.

### -The top 1% of Canadians make about 14% of all income.

### - About 16% of Canadians over the age of 15 use cannabis.

## Descriptive claims:

### *Descriptive* claim:

#### Claim about something that is (was) in the world or the state of the world

## Some new questions {.build}

### - Why does the U.S. have more firearms homicides per capita than Canada?

### - Why has the share of income going to the top 1% increased nearly twofold since 1977?

### - Would legalizing cannabis result in higher rates of impaired driving?

## What kinds of questions are these?

### How are they different from the first set?

## Some new claims {.build}

### - The US has more firearms homicides per capita than Canada because the US has laxer gun laws than Canada.

### - Income inequality in Canada is higher than 40 years ago, because tax rates on the highest earners have been reduced.

### - Legalizing cannabis would cause in higher rates of impaired driving.

## Causal claims:

### Claims about:

- the **effect** that one thing has (had) on another thing
- the **cause** of some event or thing in the world

## Causal claims:

### How to recognize them:

Causal claims include a **causal verb**. E.g.:

> "causes", "influences","makes happen", "increases", "decreases", "results in", "was necessary for", etc.

## Causal claims: Variations

### *Why* an event/condition/choice happens or doesn't happen:

>- Riots in Ayodhya happened **because** the BJP led a provocative march.

## Causal claims: Variations

### *Why* an event/condition/choice happens or doesn't happen:

-  Riots in Ayodhya happened **because** the BJP led a provocative march.

### The *conditions* under which an event/outcome/choice *happens*:

>- Contact with someone from an oppressed group can change opinions about that group **only when** people have little knowledge or experience with that group.

## Causal claims: Variations

### The *effect* of an event/condition on other things:

>- Government multicultural policies in favor of tolerance **reduce** ethnic hatreds.

## Causal claims: Variations

### The *effect* of an event/condition on other things:

- Government multicultural policies in favor of tolerance **reduce** ethnic hatreds.

### The *process* through which one thing affects another:

>- Secular political parties **prevent** religious violence **by** deploying police more aggressively.

## Causal claims: Variations

### *Why* an event/condition/choice happens or doesn't happen:

### The *conditions* under which an event/outcome/choice *happens*:

### The *effect* of an event/condition on other things:

### The *process* through which one thing affects another:


## How are *causal* claims different? {.build}

### The city of Chicago has strict gun laws and a high gun-related murder rate.

>- is this descriptive or causal?

>- NOT causal

## Descriptive and causal claims: {.build}

### How are they related?

- Descriptive claims basis for causal claim

### What would causal claim be without descriptive claims?

## Examples: {.build}

### - The US has more firearms homicides per capita than Canada because the US has laxer gun laws than Canada.

### - Income inequality in Canada is higher than 40 years ago, because tax rates on the highest earners have been reduced.

### - Legalizing cannabis would cause in higher rates of impaired driving.

## Some more questions  {.build}

### - Should the US have stricter gun control?

### - Should the taxes on the richest Canadians be increased?

### - Should new regulations place restrictions on driving while using cannabis?

## What kinds of questions are these?

## Some more claims:  {.build}

### - The US **should** enact stricter gun control

### - Parliament **should** increase taxes on the rich.

### - New regulations **should** make it illegal to drive while using cannabis.

## Normative/Prescriptive Claims: {.build}

### Claims about what *should or should not* be (or have been) done.

- Claims about what is "right" or "wrong"
- Claims abut "too much", "enough", "not enough" of something
    - implies that something *should* change

## Relationship to descriptive claims:

### Could we have a prescriptive claim without descriptive claims?

## Examples {.build}

### - British voters did the right thing for their country by voting for "Brexit".

### - China is better off under its current government than it would be as a competitive democracy.

### - The US and its allies should have intervened in Syria to stop violence in 2011

## Housing prices in BC {.build}

### - Are housing prices in BC too high?

### - Why have housing prices in BC increased dramatically in the past 15 years?

### - Why has the NDP opposed a ban on foreign ownership of property?

### - Should the BC government limit property ownership to residents?

### - How many people commute to Vancouver for work and cannot afford to live there?

## Housing prices in BC

### - Are housing prices in BC too high? *prescriptive*

### - Why have housing prices in BC increased dramatically in the past 15 years? *causal*

### - Why has the NDP opposed a ban on foreign ownership of property? *causal*

### - Should the BC government limit property ownership to residents? *prescriptive*

### - How many people commute to Vancouver for work and cannot afford to live there? *descriptive*


## Summary:

### Descriptive claims

- No explicit statement that one thing causes another

- correlation $\neq$ causation

## 

#### During years in which more (fewer) Japanese passenger cars were sold in the US there were more (fewer) vehicular suicides in the US.

## Summary:

### Causal claims

- **Explicit** statement that one thing exerts influence on another
    - (increase, reduce, prevent, cause, make happen, is necessary, etc.)

## Summary: {.build}

### Causal claims

Does this claim imply that, *if* we could directly change one thing, then we would see a change in the other?


## Summary:

### Example:

"Countries with more women in the legislature have more protections for womens' reproductive and marital rights."

>- Is this a causal claim?

### Example:

"The entry of more women into a legislature results in more legal protections for womens' reproductive and marital rights."

>- If we forced more women into government, we would expect to see a change. CAUSAL

## Summary: 

### Prescriptive/normative

- Builds on descriptive, causal claims
- But we must invoke some value-judgment about what is desirable/undesirable


## Wednesday:

### How are these types of claims related?

### Which types of claims can be judged **scientifically**?
