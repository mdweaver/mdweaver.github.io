# Measurement

## Recap {.build}


### Concept 

### $\xrightarrow{}$

### Variable 

- Something **observable** that captures/maps onto concept

### $\xrightarrow{}$

### Measure:

- Procedure for observing the variable

## Concept to Measurement:

### Concept:

- An **abstract** definition for characteristics of or types of phenomena, groups, or individuals.

### Variable:

A **measurable property** of a phenomena, group, or individual that takes on different values (it *vari*es). Maps onto a concept.

### Measure:

A **procedure** for determining the value of a variable for **specific cases** based on **observation**.


## Concept to Measurement: Concepts

**dimensions of a concept**: phenomena that both:

1. Are **part** of the concept

2. Could exist, disappear, change **independently** of one another. They are **not redundant**


## Concept to Measurement: Variables 

### Levels of Measurement:

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio

### Choices:

- Absolute levels
- Relative levels

## Testing Claims:

### Causal Theory vs. Causal Claim

- Concepts $\xrightarrow{}$ Variables
    - Independent (Cause) and Dependent (Outcome) Variables
- Direction of effect
- Causal logic

# But how do we decide what measurement to use?

# Examples

## Political Knowledge:

### Democracy:

- Does democratic governance require that citizens have sufficient knowledge to make decisions?

### What might they need to know?

>- What are government policies?
>- What policies do parties/candidates support?
>- What are effects of various policies on their (citizen's) interests?


## Political Knowledge:

What do people actually know?

### Not a lot:



## Political Knowledge:

Does the kind of knowledge required for democracy correspond to questions about current events, institutional rules of government? 

### Two measures:

- Survey people on factual questions; more correct answers mean more knowledge

- Interviewer talks with person for a two hours, then rates their knowledge.


## Racial Bias in Police Shootings

Recent renewal of long-standing controversy:

### Is police/government violence in the US biased against African Americans?

### How would we know?

One way is to think of "statistical discrimination":

- Are African Americans treated differently to white Americans in otherwise identical situations?
- Requires measuring things like "objective threat" to a police officer posed by a suspect

## Racial Bias in Police Shootings

How do we measure "objective threat" in a civilian-police officer interaction?

## Guns {.build}

### Gun Control vs Self Defense

Many argue that guns provide a means of self-defense and can deter crime

### Measurement

How would we measure whether this occurs?

## Guns

### Survey people 

Ask about their use of firearms, ask if they use in self-defense, then obtain details to clarify whether it was in fact a use of a firearm in a situation with another person.

Ask about whether these incidents occurred during criminal actions

# Problems

## Measurement Trouble

### Validity

**validity of a measure**: 

- Degree of fit between a measurement procedure for a variable, and the concept that the variable is intended to capture
- How well as measure "captures" or "maps onto" the concept


## Measurement Trouble

### Threats to validity

Validity can break down in two places:

1. Concept $\xrightarrow{Mismatch}$ Variable
2. Variable $\xrightarrow{Mismatch}$ Measure


## Measurement Trouble

### Threats to validity

1. Measure does not cover **enough**s of the concept:
    - Measure only captures some but not all relevant **dimensions** of the concept
    
    
## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Political knowledge needed for democratic citizen

**Variable**: Recall of factual questions about current politicians, political parties

**Measure**: Survey containing a list of factual questions

### Factual recall may not capture all of the kinds of knowledge that is relevant

- Knowing you and all of your neighbors lost their jobs and are struggling might be enough information to vote against incumbent

- Breakdown at Concept/Variable


## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Political Participation in Democracy

**Variable**: Frequency with which a person participates in political activity

**Measure**: Survey containing questions about frequency of voting in elections

### Voting may not be the only kind of political activity that is relevant

- Working on  campaigns, protesting, writing to representatives could also be participation
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure


## Measurement Trouble

### Threats to validity

1. Measure does not cover **enough** of the concept:
    - Measure only captures some but not all relevant **dimensions** of the concept
2. Measure covers things **outside** the concept:
    - Could cover somethings inside the concept, or **nothing** inside the concept
    
## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Political knowledge needed for democratic citizen

**Variable**: Level of perceptiveness about politics and political issues

**Measure**: Survey where interviewer rates respondent after questions and discussion.

### Interviewer may bring in things outside of "political knowledge" when rating

- Respondent's verbal skills/ agreement between interviewer and respondent
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure

## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Self Defense Gun Use

**Variable**: Event where person deters crime using a firearm

**Measure**: Survey where people report their use of firearms to deter crimes

### People may be bad at reporting their use of guns

- Respondents perceive crimes that are not there (people actually use their weapons to threaten others)
- Respondents inflate their ego by exaggerating threat (estimated 400,000 murders prevented by firearms annually)
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure

## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Political Corruption

**Variable**: Rate of corruption among individual politicians in a place

**Measure**: Rate of corruption prosecutions among politicians in a place

### Does this capture **anything** inside the concept?

- Places with lots of corruption do not prosecute corruption
- Places with low corruption successfully prosecute corruption
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure

## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Framing/Racial Priming of government social programs

**Variable**: Portrayal of social programs as "Welfare" or "Assistance to the Poor"

**Measure**: Survey people on support for "welfare" or "assistance to the poor"

### Does this capture the concept?

- "Welfare" might have racial connotation in the US.
- But, people actually think of different policies when asked about "welfare" and "assistance to the poor".
- Variable captures both framing AND policy preferences.
- Breakdown at Concept/Variable

## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Racism

**Variable**: Opposition to having neighbor of a different race

**Measure**: Survey people on opposition to having a neighbor of a different race

### Does this capture the concept?

- People are unlikely to be truthful: desirability bias
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure

## Measurement Trouble:

### List Experiments?

> "I am going to read ou a list of things that sometimes make people angry, after I read them just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. I don't want to know which ones."

## Measurement Trouble {.columns-2}

1. Increase in gasoline tax
2. Professional athletes with multi-million $ contract
3. Large industrial corporations polluting
4. Construction of high-rise in your neighborhood

1. Increase in gasoline tax
2. Professional athletes with multi-million dollar contract
3. Large industrial corporations polluting
4. Black family moving in next door


## Measurement Trouble

### Threats to validity

1. Measure does not cover **enough** of the concept:
    - Measure only captures some but not all relevant **dimensions** of the concept
2. Measure covers things **outside** the concept:
    - Could cover somethings inside the concept, or **nothing** inside the concept
    - Measure of concept cannot be a **cause** or an **effect** of the concept
3. Measure captures different things across units: **non-comparability**

## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Objective threat to police

**Variable**: Possession of a weapon by suspect

**Measure**: Reported possession of weapon in police officer report after Officer Involved Shooting

### Does this capture the concept?

- Police might report item as a weapon differently in case of black vs. white suspect
- Measurement is not the same across units
- Breakdown at Variable/Measure


## Measurement Trouble {.build}

**Concept**: Exposure to political information

**Variable**: Frequency of reading a newspaper

**Measure**: Survey of people asking for frequency with which they read a newspaper

### Does this capture the concept?

- If we want to compare exposure to political information over time, this could be a problem
- In the 1940s/1950s, newspapers major source of information, but now televisiona nd internet more common.
- Breakdown at Concept/Variable

## Measurement Trouble

### Reliability

**reliability of a measure**: 

- How consistently a measurement procedure produces the same result, when repeated for the same case
    - If two researchers use same procedure, do they get the same result?
    
## Reliability vs Validity {.vcenter .flexbox}

## Reliability vs Validity

### Measuring Individual Income:

|               | **Less Valid**                             | **More Valid**                 |
|:-------------:|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Less Reliable** | Are you high, middle, or low income?    | What is your annual income? |
| **More Reliable** | What is the make and model of your car? | Tax Records                 |



## Measurement Trouble

### Threats to Reliability

1. Room for researcher **interpretation**. **Imprecise** procedures for measurement
    - Expert Ratings (e.g. democracy)
    - Assessing motives (e.g. Donald Trump and "Muslim ban")
    - Assessing motives (e.g. Police shootings)

2. **Instability**: measurement may be unstable over time, even when underlying phenomenon is stable.
    - People's responses to interview questions change
    - Survey response can change due to "randomness": memory/recall, different circumstances
    - Repeated measures can help
