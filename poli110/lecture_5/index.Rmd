# Varieties of Claims

## Plan for Today

### 1) **Normative vs. Empirical Claims**

### 2) **Two Varieties of Normative Claims**

### 3) **Normative Claims and Science**

# An Example

---

<img src="./nyt_editorial.png" width = 90%>

## An Example:

#### **(1) US is not experiencing mass immigration**

- Lebanon (4.4 million people) has had more than 1 million refugees in less than 10 years (>25%)
- American (325 million people) has 44 million immigrants (13.7 percent)
- Rate of immigration to US has slowed over the past 10 years 

#### **(2) High immigration rates do not lead to instability.**

- Canada and Australia have populations that are 20 and 28 percent foreign-born, but no major political problems

## An Example:

#### **(3) US labor market can provide jobs to immigrants**

- Unemployment among immigrants is lower than native-born Americans

#### **(4) Lack of immigration will slow US economic growth**
 
- Fertility rates among native-born Americans are dropping
- Because of that, future workforce will be smaller, productivity will be less, growth will slow

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

- So growth rates can remain high

## POLL

Indicate which of these five claims can be supported or rejected using scientific evidence?

--- 

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

<br>

(1) US is not experiencing mass immigration $\checkmark$

(2) High immigration rates do not lead to instability $\checkmark$

(3) US labor market can provide jobs to immigrants $\checkmark$

(4) Lack of immigration will slow US economic growth $\checkmark$

(5) **America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year** 

### Even if 1-4 are true, what must we to **assume** to conclude that (5) is **true**?

--- 

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

<br>

**"America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year"**

### Even if 1-4 are true: we need to assume that **economic growth** is **desirable** to conclude that (5) is true.


## Varieties of Claims

### **Which varieties of claims/questions can be addressed with science?**

### Three dimensions

1. **Empirical vs. Normative**
2. **Varieties** of empirical and **normative claims/questions**
3. Falsifiable vs. unfalsifiable

## Empirical Claims

#### **empirical claim**:

<br>

is a claim about **what is/exists** or **how things that exist affect each other**. 

<br>

The **basis**/evidence for empirical claims

- consists of **observation** of the world.
- **no assumption** about what is good/desirable. 

## Normative Claims

#### **normative claim**:

<br>

is a claim about **what is desirable or undesirable**. 

- assert what **should or should not** be. 
- "should" implied by the language of "right"/"wrong" 
- "should" implied by "too much", "enough", or "not enough" of something.
- "should" implied by standards for what is "better"/"worse"

The basis/evidence for a normative claim:

- **must assume** a **value judgment** about what is desirable/undesirable


## Which are empirical? Normative?

(1) **US is not experiencing mass immigration** 

(2) **High immigration rates do not lead to instability**

(3) **US labor market can provide jobs to immigrants** 

(4) **Lack of immigration will slow US economic growth**

(5) **America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year** 

# Normative Claims

## Normative Claims:

#### **value judgments**:

<br>

are normative claims that

- state what goal or ideal is "right" or "good" 
- or provide criteria/rules for judging what is "better" or "worse".

<br>

#### **They are not:**

- empirical claims for which the evidence is **flawed**
- empirical claims that we can't persuade someone to drop in the face of better evidence

"Vancouver is a city on the edge. It seems politicians and the police are unable, unwilling or incapable of stopping what has turned into a version of Dante's Hell on the Downtown Eastside — illicit drug sales, open drug use, the stolen property bazaar, garbage, weapons, assaults, rape.

Vancouver no longer has a public health crisis that can be solved by needle exchanges, supervised injection sites, a naloxone-carting population, and pharmaceuticals substituted for illicit drugs. It is going to take more to solve the housing crisis by repurposing older hotels and simply putting roofs over people’s heads — a lot more.

Solving it requires bold leadership and a willingness to go beyond what has been done in the past, using evidence-based solutions that are in the best interests of all residents. Everyone deserves to feel safe, protected and respected, regardless of which neighbourhood they live in."</smaller>

## Prescriptive Claims

#### **prescriptive claims**: 

<br>

are normative claims that assert what kinds of actions **should** be taken 

- hint: like a doctor or pharmacist, it *prescribes* a course of action. 

The basis/evidence for a prescriptive claim includes 

- evidence supporting an **empirical** claim about the consequences of some action (causal claim)
- an assumption that some **value judgment** is correct.

## Revisit our Example

$(5)$ America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year.

### **Value judgment? Prescriptive Claim?**

## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

This is a **prescriptive claim**:

For it to be true...

(1) What value judgments must we assume to be true?

(2) What empirical claims must be true?



## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

This is a **prescriptive claim**:

#### **Evidence will not "prove" this claim to everyone**

e.g. people who oppose immigration to achieve cultural homogeneity value **cultural homogeneity** more than **economic growth**.

# Science and Claims

## Science and Claims

### **Empirical claims:** can be evaluated using science

- only need to assume that there is an objective world that we share
- other assumptions about how we provide evidence of that objective world open to question
- science is about prediction

### **Normative claims:** cannot (fully) be evaluated using science

- **value judgments** cannot be evaluated with science
- **prescriptive claims** can only partially be evaluated with science

# Another Example

## Another example

Imagine you work on the staff of a Cabinet Minister. The current government has finite resources to address the spike in pandemic.

We all **agree**: we should aim to **minimize deaths**.

### You and your colleagues disagree on which policies do this

(1) Plan A: [vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vaccine-mandate-double-down-convoy-1.6326821)

(2) Plan B: [purchase and distribute large numbers of rapid antigen tests](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-rapid-test-crunch-1.6323448)

(3) Plan C: deploy Canadian Armed Forces to create field hospitals for non-ICU COVID patients


## POLL


## Discuss:

Which plan is best?

(Assuming our only goal is to minimize deaths)... Can science tell us which plan we should adopt?

## Another example {.build}
 
### If we had Empirical Evidence on...

1. cross-border truckers as disease vectors, vulnerability of direct/indirect contacts
2. efficacy of access to rapid tests on reducing transmission, exposure to vulnerable
3. probability of mortality in COVID field wards, preventable deaths due to insufficient staff/resources in civilian hospitals

Could assess which plan would yield the fewest deaths...

## Another example

What if **you value** minimizing death, **I value** maximizing individual freedom, and **your friend values** minimizing price of consumer goods

Which plan should we decide to support?

(1) Plan A: [vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vaccine-mandate-double-down-convoy-1.6326821)

(2) Plan B: [purchase and distribute large numbers of rapid antigen tests](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-rapid-test-crunch-1.6323448)

(3) Plan C: deploy Canadian Armed Forces to create field hospitals for non-ICU COVID patients

>- **Could the scientific evidence resolve our dispute?**

##  Another example (Summary)

### "My Omicron policy response (X) minimizes deaths (Y)"

- Scientific Evidence that "X causes Y" **does not imply** "we should do Y"

- Depends on how we **value** Y; conflicting values cannot be resolved by science

### But...

- If we assume less death is good (*a value judgment*)
- What if science showed: Plan A (X) does **not** reduce deaths (Y). (*empirical evidence*)
- "X does/does not cause Y" is informative! Science is helpful!

## Conclusion:

1. Empirical vs Normative Claims
2. Value Judgements
3. Prescriptive Claims
