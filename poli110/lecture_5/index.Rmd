# Varieties of Claims

## Plan for Today

### 1) **Normative vs. Empirical Claims**

### 2) **Two Varieties of Normative Claims**

### 3) **Normative Claims and Science**

- Group Projects

# An Example

---

<img src="./nyt_editorial.png" width = 90%>

## An Example:

#### **(1) US is not experiencing high levels of immigration**

- Lebanon (4.4 million people) has had more than 1 million refugees in less than 10 years (>25%)
- American (325 million people) has 44 million immigrants (13.7 percent)
- Rate of immigration to US has slowed over the past 10 years 

#### **(2) High immigration rates do not lead to political instability.**

- Canada and Australia have populations that are 20 and 28 percent foreign-born, but no major political problems

## An Example:

#### **(3) New immigrants will find employment.**

- Unemployment among immigrants is lower than native-born Americans

#### **(4) Lower immigration will slow US economic growth**
 
- Fertility rates among native-born Americans are dropping
- Because of that, future workforce will be smaller, productivity will be less, growth will slow

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

- So growth rates can remain high

## An Example:

Which of these five claims can be **supported** or **rejected** using scientific evidence?

Head to menti.com and use code $89 \ 53$

Select all that apply.

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

<br>

(1) US is not experiencing high levels of immigration $\checkmark$

(2) High immigration rates do not lead to political instability $\checkmark$

(3) New immigrants will find employment $\checkmark$

(4) Lower immigration will slow US economic growth $\checkmark$

(5) **America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year** 

### Even if 1-4 are true, what must we to **assume** to conclude that (5) is **true**?

--- 

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

<br>

**"America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year"**

### Even if 1-4 are true: we need to assume that **economic growth** is **desirable** to conclude that (5) is true.

## Varieties of Claims

### **Which varieties of claims/questions can be addressed with science?**

### Three dimensions

1. **Empirical vs. Normative**
2. **Varieties** of empirical and **normative claims/questions**
3. Falsifiable vs. unfalsifiable

## Empirical Claims

#### **empirical claim**:

<br>

is a claim about **what is/exists** or **how things that exist affect each other**. 

<br>

The **basis**/evidence for empirical claims

- consists of **observation** of the world.
- **no assumption** about what is good/desirable. 

## Normative Claims

#### **normative claim**:

<br>

is a claim about **what is desirable or undesirable**. 

- assert what **should or should not** be. 
- "should" implied by the language of "right"/"wrong" 
- "should" implied by "too much", "enough", or "not enough" of something.
- "should" implied by standards for what is "better"/"worse"

The basis/evidence for a normative claim:

- **must assume** a **value judgment** about what is desirable/undesirable


## Which are empirical? Normative?

(1) **US is not experiencing high levels of immigration**

(2) **High immigration rates do not lead to political instability**

(3) **New immigrants will find employment**

(4) **Lower immigration will slow US economic growth**

(5) **America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year** 

# Normative Claims

## Normative Claims:

#### **value judgments**:

<br>

are normative claims that

- state what goal or ideal is "right" or "good" 
- or provide criteria/rules for judging what is "better" or "worse".

<br>

#### **They are not:**

- empirical claims for which the evidence is **invalid or missing**
- empirical claims that we can't persuade someone to drop in the face of better evidence

"Vancouver is a city on the edge. It seems politicians and the police are unable, unwilling or incapable of stopping what has turned into a version of Dante's Hell on the Downtown Eastside — illicit drug sales, open drug use, the stolen property bazaar, garbage, weapons, assaults, rape.

Vancouver no longer has a public health crisis that can be solved by needle exchanges, supervised injection sites, a naloxone-carting population, and pharmaceuticals substituted for illicit drugs. It is going to take more to solve the housing crisis by repurposing older hotels and simply putting roofs over people’s heads — a lot more.

Solving it requires bold leadership and a willingness to go beyond what has been done in the past, using evidence-based solutions that are in the best interests of all residents. Everyone deserves to feel safe, protected and respected, regardless of which neighbourhood they live in."</smaller>

## Prescriptive Claims

#### **prescriptive claims**: 

<br>

are normative claims that assert what kinds of actions **should** be taken 

- hint: like a doctor or pharmacist, it *prescribes* a course of action. 

The basis/evidence for a prescriptive claim includes 

- evidence supporting an **empirical** claim about the consequences of some action (causal claim)
- an assumption that some **value judgment** is correct.

## Revisit our Example

$(5)$ America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year.

### **Value judgment? Prescriptive Claim?**

## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

This is a **prescriptive claim**:

For it to be true...

(1) What value judgments must we assume to be true?

(2) What empirical claims must be true?


## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

<br>

**Evidence will not "prove" this claim to everyone**

e.g. people who oppose immigration to achieve cultural homogeneity value **cultural homogeneity** more than **economic growth**.

# Science and Claims

## Science and Claims

### **Empirical claims:** can be evaluated using science

- only need to assume that there is an objective world that we share
- other assumptions about how we provide evidence of that objective world open to question

### **Normative claims:** cannot (fully) be evaluated using science

- **value judgments** cannot be evaluated with science
- **prescriptive claims** can only partially be evaluated with science

# Another Example

## Another Example

You and your friends win a large sum of money in a lottery

You and your friends **agree**: you should aim to **do the most good** by donating the money.

<br>

You consider some options...

## Another Example

Which should you donate to?

- Option 1: Make-a-Wish (more Batkid, pls)
- Option 2: Mosquito Nets
- Option 3: Direct transfer of cash to impoverished people

## Can science solve our problem? 

Peter Singer and effective altruists say yes!

- we can evaluate which of these does the most good!

## Can science solve our problem? {.build}

### Empirical Evidence

- Malaria kills ~500k per year
- Half of global population possibly exposed
- Mosquito nets reduce likelihood of exposure
- For each 100 to 1000 nets, 1 death prevented
- Cost of mosquito nets is low
- Cash transfers are expensive, effects on mortality unclear
- Sums must be very large to affect mortality

### **What should you do?**

### **Malaria nets!**

## Can science solve our problem?

But wait, your friend says: experiments show that directly giving cash

- benefits the health, education, and life choices of children
- empowers women to be financially independent, escape abuse
- improve mental health

### **What should you do?**

## Can science solve our problem?

If **you value** minimizing suffering, but **your friend values** maximizing individual freedom...

then science cannot help us, because the disagreement is rooted in **value judgements**

##  Another Example

**"We should donate money for mosquito nets"** is a prescriptive claim.

<br>

- Scientific evidence for empirical claim that "Mosquito nets (A) prevent malaria (B)" 
    - NOT enough to conclude that does not imply "we should do (A)": it depends on how we **value** B
- if we also accept **value judgement** that it reducing suffering is more important than maximizing freedom (or coolness)
    - THEN we can accept the prescriptive claim
    
Need to accept the **causal** (empirical) claim that $A \to B$ AND a value judgment that $B$ is good.
    
##  Another Example

Science can still be helpful!

- If we assume less mortality is good (B) (a value judgment)
- What if science shows: mosquito nets don't prevent malaria deaths. (empirical evidence)
- "A does/does not cause B" is informative!


## Conclusion:

1. Empirical vs Normative Claims
2. Value Judgements
3. Prescriptive Claims
