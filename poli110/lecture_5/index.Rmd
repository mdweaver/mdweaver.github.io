# Recap

## Why do we care about truth?

One main argument is:

Exercise of power involves someone else motivating us with reasons to do or think something else.

## Reasons

The reasons given to use greater enforcement powers involve claims:

- "most political violence is perpetrated by the left"
- "rhetoric  from left-leaning organzations led to the assassination"
- "political violence is illegitimate"
- "US government should use investigations to target organizations producing the rhetoric that leads to violence"

## Reasons

Some of these reasons are **empirical** claims; some are **normative claims**

- **diagnostic frames**: there is a "problem" to be fixed. 
- **prescriptive claims**: there is a "solution" we should use. 


## Science and Reasons

Scientific Evidence can only be used with **empirical** claims:

- "most political violence is perpetrated by the left"
- "rhetoric  from left-leaning organzations led to the assassination"

>- Is this still worthwhile?

## Probing Claims

When we are given reasons to do something (e.g. accept the use of police powers to target political rivals) 

- claims diagnosing a **problem**
- claims **prescribing** a solution 

involve value judgments. But they also involve empirical claims.

>- We want to look at whether the evidence for the empirical claims was capable of showing those claims to be wrong
>- We want evidence that has thoroughly checked whether the claim is wrong.

## Severity and Good Reasons

If the evidence we are given to accept power over us **would always** support the claims, even if the claims are false, we are not **free**. Bad evidence $\to$ Bad reasons

# Science and Diagnostic Frames


## Science and Diagnostic Frames

Claims that there is a "problem" involve a **value judgment** and **descriptive claims**

- "political violence is bad" (a **value judgment**)
- "political left is perpetrating political violence"

## Science and Diagnostic Frames

Evaluating **descriptive claims** are relevant to "diagnostic frames":

- How much political violence is there, really? (Compared to other violence)
- How much political violence is committed by the left? (As opposed to other groups)

>- When people tell us there is a **problem**, there is a value judgement about what is good or bad. We can use scientific evidence to check whether this "problem" is real 

## Severity and Descriptive Claims:

Where can evidence for descriptive claims go wrong?

>- How do we define what we are trying to observe? (What is "political violence"? Who is a "leftist"?) Can that definition be used objectively? 
>- What will we observe that correspond to these definitions? (What could we observe that counts as "political violence"?)
>- How/What procedure will we use to actually observe these things?
>- What could go wrong at each stage that would lead us to incorrectly conclude the claim is right (wrong)?


# Science and Prescriptive Claims

---

<img src="./nyt_editorial.png" width = 90%>

An attempt to motivate people to behave differently. An attempt to exercise power. Access to media outlets enables power.

## An Example:

#### **(1) US is not experiencing (comparatively) high levels of immigration**

- Lebanon (4.4 million people) has had more than 1 million refugees in less than 10 years (>25%)
- American (325 million people) has 44 million immigrants (13.7 percent)
- Rate of immigration to US has slowed over the past 10 years 

#### **(2) High immigration rates do not lead to political instability.**

- Canada and Australia have populations that are 20 and 28 percent foreign-born, but no major political problems

## An Example:

#### **(3) New immigrants are employed at high rates.**

- Unemployment among immigrants is lower than native-born Americans
- not a burden on state provision of social services

#### **(4) Lower immigration slows economic growth**
 
- Fertility rates among native-born Americans are dropping
- Because of that, future workforce will be smaller, productivity will be less, growth will slow

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

- So growth rates can remain high

---

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

$\checkmark$ if science could test:

(1) US is not experiencing high levels of immigration $\checkmark$

(2) High immigration rates do not lead to political instability $\checkmark$

(3) New immigrants are employed at high rates $\checkmark$

(4) Lower immigration slows economic growth $\checkmark$

(5) **America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year** 

### Even if 1-4 are true, what must we to **assume** to conclude that (5) is **true**?


## Prescriptive Claims

#### **prescriptive claims**: 

<br>

are normative claims that assert what kinds of actions **should** be taken 

- hint: like a doctor or pharmacist, it *prescribes* a course of action. 
- overlap with justifications/reasons given by power.

The basis for a prescriptive claim includes 

- evidence supporting an **empirical** claim about the consequences of some action (**causal claim**)
- an assumption that some **value judgment** is correct.


## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

This is a **prescriptive claim**:

For it to be true...

(1) What value judgments must we assume to be true?

(2) What empirical claims must be true?

--- 

### **"Actually, the Numbers [Don't] Show That"**

<br>

**"America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year"**

### Even if 1-4 are true: we need to assume that **economic growth** is **desirable** to conclude that (5) is true.

## Revisit our Starting Example

#### **(5) America *should* admit 1 million more immigrants per year**

<br>

**scientific evidence cannot "prove" this claim**

even if we evidence that is **very capable** of finding any **flaws** in claim that increasing immigration increases economic growth... (strong severity)

people who value **cultural/ethnic homogeneity** more than **economic growth** can't be persuaded


# Another Example

## Another Example

You and your friends win a large sum of money in a lottery

You and your friends **agree**: you want to **do the most good** by donating the money.

<br>

You consider some options...

## Another Example

Which should you donate to?

- Option 1: Make-a-Wish (more Batkid, pls)
- Option 2: Mosquito Nets
- Option 3: Direct transfer of cash to impoverished people

## Can science solve our problem? 

Peter Singer and effective altruists say yes!

- we can evaluate which of these does the most good!

> "Saving a child's life has to be better than fulfilling a childâ€™s wish to be Batkid."

## Can science solve our problem? {.build}

### Empirical Evidence

- Malaria kills ~500k per year
- Half of global population possibly exposed
- Mosquito nets reduce likelihood of exposure
- For each 100 to 1000 nets, 1 death prevented
- Cost of mosquito nets is low
- Cash transfers are expensive, effects on mortality unclear
- Batchildren encourage vigilante justice

### **What should you do?**

### **Malaria nets!**

## Can science solve our problem?

But wait, your friend says: experiments show that directly giving cash

- benefits the health, education, and life choices of children
- empowers women to be financially independent, escape abuse
- improve mental health

### **What should you do?**

## Can science solve our problem?

If **you value** minimizing suffering, but **your friend values** maximizing individual freedom...

then science cannot help us, because the disagreement is rooted in **value judgements**

##  Another Example

**"We should donate money for mosquito nets"** is a prescriptive claim.

<br>

- Scientific evidence for empirical claim that "Mosquito nets (A) prevent malaria (B)" 
    - NOT enough to conclude that does not imply "we should do (A)": it depends on how we **value** B
- if we also accept **value judgement** that it reducing suffering is more important than maximizing freedom (or coolness)
    - THEN we can accept the prescriptive claim
    
Need to accept the **causal** (empirical) claim that $A \to B$ AND a value judgment that $B$ is good.
    
##  Another Example

Science is still be helpful!

- If we assume less mortality is good (B) (a value judgment)
- What if science shows: mosquito nets don't prevent malaria deaths. (empirical evidence)
- "A does/does not cause B" is informative!

## Severity and Causal Claims:

Where can evidence for causal claims go wrong?

>- What is causality?
>- When and why might the relationship (correlation) between factors **not** be the result of causation
>- What comparisons can we make to provide evidence of causation?
>- What do these comparisons **assume** to count as evidence of causation?
>- Is it possible that the evidence we are using could show a relationship that is not causal?

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

Learning to recognize what evidence is capable of proving claims wrong:

- how and why could evidence **find support for a claim** even if the **claim is wrong**
- what **assumptions** permit evidence to able to find claims to be wrong (when they are wrong)
