## Objectives

### (1) **Sampling Error**

- **Sampling Bias** vs **Random Sampling Error**
- **Random Sampling**

### (2) **Sampling Error** vs **Measurement Error**

# Measurement Error


## If errors, then...

1. We need to distinguish between **random** and **systematic** errors. Does the **source** of the error suggest a **systematic** direction to the error?

2. Does the evidence using this measure appear to support or reject the claim?

3. Is the **magnitude** of the error likely to be large or small? Is it possible to assess how wrong it could be?

4. If the error is a bias, what is the **direction** of the bias?  (upward?, downward?)


---

### Bias: When is it a problem?

If:

- the evidence appears to **support** the claim:
- measurement biased **in the direction** of the claim (fails **weak severity**)
- bias has **large magnitude**

Then, bias is a problem. Claim could be true or false.

---

### Bias: When is it a problem?

If:

- the evidence appears to **support** the claim:
- measurement biased **in the opposite direction** of the claim 
- bias has **large or small magnitude**

Then, bias is **not** a problem. Procedure stacks the deck against the claim, yet still supports it.


---

### Bias: When is it a problem?

If:

- the evidence appears to **reject** the claim:
- measurement biased **in the direction** of the claim 
- bias has **large or small magnitude**

Then, bias is **not** a problem. Procedure stacks the deck in favor of the claim, yet still rejects it.

# Sampling Error

## Sampling

### **Sometimes we cannot answer descriptive claims directly**

We would have to observe **too many** cases.

### Example:

Ahead of the upcoming Federal elections:

**"What proportion of Canadians prefer Justin Trudeau to be the next Prime Minister?"**

<br>

We can't interview **all Canadians**...

## Sampling

### Survey of  $1009$ Canadian adults (09/11-10/11 2024)

<img src="./trudeau_poll.png" width=80%>

## Sampling

### Key terms:

**population**: full set of cases (countries, individuals, etc.) we're interested in describing

**sample**: a *subset* of the population that we observe and measure

**inference**: description of the (unmeasured) **population** we make *based on the (measured) **sample***

and there is **uncertainty** about what is true about the population, because we **only measure a sample**

## Example:

[Measuring voting preferences](https://nanos.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Political-Package-2024-10-11-FOR-RELEASE.pdf)

The **population**:

- All Canadian adults (18 years of age or older)

The **sample**: 

- $1009$ Canadians interviewed from random digit dialing of land lines and cell lines. Each line tried 5 times, between 5-9 pm on weekdays (12-6 pm on weekends). Weighted according to age, gender, and geographic region, as per 2021 Census.

The **inference**:

- 21% ($\pm 3.1$%) of Canadians say prefer Trudeau as Prime Minister 


---

### **sampling error**:

The difference between the value of the measure for the sample and the true value of the measure for the population

$$\mathrm{Value}_{sample} - \mathrm{Value}_{population} \neq 0 \xrightarrow{then} \mathrm{sampling \ error}$$

>- Just like **measurement error**, there are two types: one that is **bias** and one that is **random**

---

### **sampling error**:

$1$. **sampling bias**: cases in the sample are not representative of the population: not every member of population has equal chance of being in sample. Error is consistently in the same direction.

---

### **sampling error**:

$2$. **random sampling error**: in choosing cases for a sample, by chance, we get samples where the average is **too high** or **too low** compared to the population average

- but these errors would cancel out (if we repeated the sampling procedure). 
- produces the **uncertainty** of sampling (e.g., margin of error).


---

### **sampling error**:

To understand **random sampling error** and **sampling bias**, it can be useful to understand...

the **sampling distribution**:

- the results from all possible samples we could get, using a given sampling procedure.
- we only ever get the result from the one sample we draw, but can **imagine** the results could have been different
- it is **not** actually knowable, except in simulations

(e.g., the percent of survey respondents who prefer Trudeau in  every possible sample of $1009$ drawn using random digit dialing)


---

We can visualize a **sampling distribution** using a **histogram** and then assess:

- is the sampling procedure **biased**?
- **how much random error is there**?


## Random Sampling

**random sampling**: sampling cases from the population in a manner that gives **all cases** an **equal probability** of being chosen.

This procedure creates **samples** that:

- on average, give **unbiased** inferences about the population (**regardless of sample size**) (no sampling bias)
    - **unbiased** in that, across all samples, on average the sample average are the same as the population average
- has **random sampling errors** with a known **size**: produces **known uncertainty** (described by the field of statistics)

(board: intuitions as to *why*)

## Example: {.build}

Let's say we want to understand housing insecurity among students in this course.

The **population** is students registered in this course

Students in lecture hall, responding to poll are the **sample**

## Example: Contacts

When we take the average rent budget for the **sample** (people taking poll in class today)...

<br>

and use it as our estimate of the average rent budget of the **population** (all students registered in this course)...

<br>

we are making an **inference**.

## Example: Contacts

Was this **sample** a **random sample** of the students in the course? 

<br>

Can you think of any reasons this **sample** (students in lecture) would suffer from **sampling bias**?

## Example: Contacts

When samples are  **not random** they may suffer from sampling **bias** and the **random errors** are of unknown size

>- students attending lecture in person may differ in their rent expenditures from those who do not (e.g., the latter may have extra jobs, have to save money on transit, higher levels of stress)

---

### **Random Sampling**

Let's now imagine that the **population** is students in class today who completed the survey...

To illustrate random sampling error: We can simulate taking **random samples** of students in class and plot the **sampling distribution**

[See here](https://mdweaver.shinyapps.io/shiny_survey/)

histogram = Sampling distribution (the averages of different random samples)

Blue line = Population Mean (true in-class average)

Red line = Sampling Distribution Mean (average of SAMPLE averages)


## Random Sampling Error

We want to know: what fraction of Canadian adults prefer Trudeau as PM?

There are ~31 million Canadians over the age of 18: assuming our sample is random, **about how many people ($n$) do you think we'd have to survey** to come up with sample mean and margin of error of $\pm 1$ points that includes the **population mean** with a probability of 99%?

>- $n \approx 16000$. It doesn't matter how many Canadians there are. The size of the random error in the sampling distribution gets smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{n}$


## Sampling Error?

If people who prefer Trudeau, but feel social pressure to give a different answer or that they "did not know"...

<br>

Is this **sampling error**? Is this a **random error** or a **bias**? 

## Sampling Error?

<img src="./538_2.png" width=90%>

Each dot is the result of a survey of voters during the 2020 US Presidential Election. These surveys suggested that by election day voters preferred Biden to Trump by $8.4$ percent. Biden **actually** won by only $4.5$ points.

Is this **sampling error**? Is this a **random error** or a **bias**? 

## Sampling Error?

It depends: if this is going on, then sampling bias

<img src="./poll_4.png" width=100%>

## Sampling Error?

It depends: if this is going on, then sampling bias

<img src="./poll_5.png" width=100%>

## Sampling Error?

It depends: if there are "shy" Trump voters, then measurement bias.
