# What is Science?

## Plan for Today

### 1) Recap

### 2) Attributes of scientific evidence

### 3) Example

# Recap

## Science as Vocation: Four Insights

#### **(1) Science (*in principle*) only assume objective knowledge exists and can be known: all other "truths" open to investigation/challenge.**

<br>

#### **(2) Science is not *value-free*: assumes certain questions worth answering.**

<br>

#### **(3) Science is fundamentally interested in prediction**

<br>

#### **(4) 'Science is meaningless because it gives no answer to our question, the only question important for us: "What shall we do and how shall we live?"' - Tolstoi**

# Scientific Evidence

## Two Key definitions

### **claim**: 

(For our purposes) a statement about what is true or valid. *If you can add "is true" to the end or "it is true that" to the beginning of the statement without changing the meaning, it is a claim.

### Don't overthink this definition. It is as simple as it seems.

## Two Key definitions

### **basis**: 

(For our purposes) the basis for a claim is the **reason we should accept the truth** or validity of that claim. It is the **evidence** that is used to "prove" the claim is true **and** the **assumptions** required for the evidence to be valid "proof" (sometimes called the "warrant")

## An example:

**claim**: "It rained last night"

**basis**: "The street is wet"

What is the evidence? What is the assumption behind that evidence? Is it a reasonable assumption?

## Using Science to Evaluate Claims

**Science** is distinct in 

#### (1) Only certain *claims* can be investigated (insights 1,3,4; next week!)

#### (2) Having special rules for using evidence and making assumptions to accept claims

## Science?

Which of these is a **fundamental** quality of **scientific** inquiry?

Explain why.

1. Exact measurement
2. Making conclusions with high certainty
3. Employing transparent procedures
4. Controlled experiments

# Scientific bases for claims:

## Scientific Bases for Claims: {.build}

### Transparent procedures

### Systematic use of evidence

### Test claim against alternatives

### Acknowledge uncertainty

## Transparent procedures {.build}

### How did you arrive at your conclusion

- What data / observations did you use?
- What comparisons did you make?
- What choices as a researcher did you make, and why

### Why?

- Others can know the assumptions required to find result
- Others can question your choices
- Others can replicate your work


## Consider alternatives {.build}

### Why?

- Openness to being wrong
- One positive piece of evidence can be consistent with many claims

### Test your claim against other competing claims

- Whichever claim "survives" many different tests is best

## Systematic Use of Evidence {.build}

### Observations we make:

- Based on clear rules for selection
- clear rules for comparison
- avoids "cherry-picking" 

### Why?

- Cherry picking assumes a truth
- Prevents us from considering alternatives
- Need to be able to consider challenge to our evidence

## Acknowledge uncertainty

Two ways:

### Limitations of your finding:

- Openness about how your evidence could still be wrong
- What questions remain unanswered after your study (what didn't it tell us)
- What assumptions did we make that might not be true?

### How certain or precise are our answers?

- Acknowledge possibility of chance relationships
- Given this, how "confident" can we be about our results being real?


# Example

## Consider a claim:

#### A person's prejudice against a group of people can be reduced through real, interpersonal contact with a member of that group.

- So-called "contact hypothesis" applied to many excluded minorities

- Contact may humanize the other group, encourage taking their perspective, dispel prejudices



## An investigation {.build}

### LaCour and Green (2014) conduct an experiment:

Can a single conversation change minds on divisive social issues, such as same-sex marriage?

Are conversations about same-sex marriage more persuasive when they are with a gay person?

## An investigation: set up

- Gay-rights organization canvassed for same-sex marriage in California
- Researchers worked with them to randomize which people received different "treatments"

### Subjects

- 972 registered voters 
- living in precincts that voted to ban same-sex marriage in 2008

## An investigation: set up

### Treatments

Subjects either saw:

- Canvasser **for** same-sex marriage who was **straight** or **gay**
- Canvasser **for** recycling program who was **straight** or **gay**
- No canvasser

### Survey

- Answered survey questions about homosexuality, same-sex marriage
- From 5 days after canvass to 280 days

## Transparent Procedures: {.build}

### Paper: 4 pages

### Supplementary Appendix: 24 pages

## Treatments:

<img src="./lacour_3.png" height = 100%>

## Who was treated?

<img src="./lacour_2.png" height = 100%>

## How did they get treated?

<img src="./lacour_4.png" height = 100%>

## What were the survey questions?

<img src="./lacour_5.png" width = 100%>

## Consider alternatives:

### Could it be that effect is from having someone come to the door?

- Not the content or the contact, simply being canvassed

## Consider alternatives:

### "Placebo" treatments help:

- Recycling treatments show no effects
- Rule out "canvass-only" effect

## Consider alternatives:

### What if gay canvassers are different that straight in other ways?

- Might be better able to articulate issue
- Might be more motivated, so more persuasive
- Might be different in other ways that make them persuasive

### Directly test these possibilities

## Systematic use of evidence:

### What was the sample?

<img src="./lacour_8.png" width = 100%>

## Systematic use of evidence:

### What were the comparisons?

<img src="./lacour_9.png" width = 100%>

## Uncertainty

### Statistical uncertainty
### Uncertainty in conclusions

## Results have confidence intervals

<img src="./lacour_11.png" width = 100%>

## Results leave questions

#### Why were indirect effects larger for gay canvassers?

#### Would this work for other identity groups?

## Findings:

### Canvassing to reduce prejudice works

### Works better and longer with gay canvassers

## Is this finding "Objective"?

### Objectivity does not extend to the question asked.

Presupposes that reducing prejudice is desirable.

Researchers could also examine how to increase prejudice (not with IRB approval!)

## Next week:

#### 1) Why is transparency so critical?

#### 2) Types of claims
