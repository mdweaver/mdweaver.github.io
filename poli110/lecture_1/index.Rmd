# Course Introduction

## Today's Agenda

### 1. Course Introduction

### 2. Course Expectations/Assignments

### 3. Course Policies

### 4. Questions


# Course Introduction

---

### Exercise {.build}

#### With your neighbors, discuss: What is the most important political problem facing the world today?

#### Discuss with your neighbors: how would you find out what is true about this issue?

(be honest with yourself... how would, not how should)

#### Does this get at the actual "truth"? Why or why not?

#### What role should "truth" play in forming your opinion on this issue?

---

### **Learning Objectives**

<div style="font-size:x-large">

- **Give reasons** for why truth is important in politics.
- **Identify** the types of claims made (implicitly or explicitly) in real-world political discourse.
- **Identify** which of these claims can be subject to scientific scrutiny.
- **Explain** what distinguishes scientific from unscientific forms of evidence.
- **Analyze** real-world descriptive and causal claims about politics and **identify** specific errors with the use of evidence and **explain** *why* these errors occurred.
- **Analyze** real-world causal claims and **identify** the types of causal evidence provided and **explain} the assumptions needed for this evidence to be valid.
- **Apply** these tools of analysis to **explain** how both claims and a critical engagement with the evidence for those claims change their opinion on the issue at hand. 

<\div>

---

### **Practically**

- Is this media or message that I am exposed to attempting to persuade me or change my behavior?
- What is this message attempting to get me to do/believe?
- How does this message attempt to persuade or motivate me?
- Does the message employ claims and evidence?
- What could go wrong with this evidence?
- What would be **better** evidence?

---

Ultimate goal is to teach critical reasoning about what is true in the world, to face up to the reality of our age:

- can be uncomfortable
- can be difficult



---

### A note

**Examples used in class**

We will likely use many examples that come from the US and the Trump Administration:

- Why? (Two Reasons)
- No need for agreement.

## Reasoning

- Thanks, OpenAI.
- Don't train LLMs to take your (future) job.
- LLMs useful tools, but won't cultivate critical thinking.
- AI tools (e.g. chat bots, Grammarly, etc.) not permitted for assignments. Welcome to use as study aid
