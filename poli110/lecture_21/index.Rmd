## Solutions to Confounding

**Every way** of using correlation as evidence for causality **makes assumptions**

- FPCI cannot be solved without assumptions
- With assumptions, can say confounding/bias is not a problem

| Solution | How Bias<br>Solved | Which Bias<br>Removed | Assumes | Internal<br>Validity | External<br>Validity |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Experiment | Randomization<br>Breaks $W \rightarrow X$ link | **All** confounding variables | 1. $X$ is random<br> 2. Change only $X$ | High | Low | 
| Conditioning | Hold confounders<br>constant | Only confounders <br> conditioned on | 1. Condition on all confounders <br> 2. Low measurement error<br> 3. Cases similar in $W$ | Low | High |


## Conditioning

### **Did Trump rallies *increase* hate crimes?**

[Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf) compare hate crimes in counties with and without Trump rallies, **condition** on (hold constant):

- percent Jewish, number of hate groups, crime rate, 2012 Republican vote share, percent university educated, region

>- But they left out population, which confounded Trump rallies and Hate Crimes.
>- Difficult to find counties without rallies similar in many traits to counties **with** rallies

---

After conditioning on population (a confounder): no correlation.

## Limits of Conditioning:

### **Did Trump rallies *increase* hate crimes?**

1. If we know confounding variables, can we find cases *with* and *without* rallies that are **the same on *many* confounding variables**?

2. If we don't know or can't measure confounding variables, may **still be differences** between places with and without rallies that produce confounding.

>- What if we compare counties **before** and **after** rallies?

# Before and After

## Example: Before and After

Taking the same data from [Feinberg, Branton, and Martinez-Ebers ](https://lmas.unt.edu/sites/lmas.unt.edu/files/lmas/Hate%20Incidents%20Spike_0.pdf)...

- we focus **only** on counties that **ever had** a Trump (Clinton) rally
- compare the month **after** the rally to the month **before** the rally

## Before and After

DISCUSS 

If we compare counties to themselves **before** and **after** rallies... 


1. Which confounding variables are held constant?

2. What are confounding variables that might NOT be addressed in this comparison?

# Design Based Solutions


## Design Based Solutions

**Conditioning** removes confounding by:

- identifying possible confounding variables
- measuring confounding variables
- examine relationship b/t $X$ and $Y$ for cases with **similar value** of confounding variables $W$.


## Design Based Solutions

**Design-based** solutions remove confounding by:

- selecting cases for comparison in order to eliminate **many** known/unknown as well as measurable/unmeasurable confounding variables.
- the nature of the comparison holds constant **classes of confounding variables**, not  **specific** confounding variables.
- by a "class" we mean all confounding variables that share specific properties (e.g., unchanging over time)


## Example: Before and After


```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
dagify(hate_crime ~ rally + jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region + pop,
      rally ~ jewish + hate_group + crime + gop + univ + region + pop,
       exposure = "rally", 
       outcome = 'hate_crime',
       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",
                  'jewish' = '% Jewish',
                  'hate_group' = '# Hate\nGroups',
                  "crime" = "Crime\nRate",
                  'gop' = 'GOP\nVoters',
                  'univ'= 'Univ.\nEducated',
                  'region' = "Region",
                  "pop" = "Population"
                  )) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link() +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
  
```

Which of these possible confounders are held constant in a before-and-after comparison (month after vs month before rally)?

## Example: Before and After

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
dagify(hate_crime ~ rally + unchanging + changing,
      rally ~ unchanging + changing,
       exposure = "rally", 
       outcome = 'hate_crime',
       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",
                  'changing' = 'Changing\nAttributes',
                  'unchanging' = 'Unchanging\nAttributes'
                  )) %>%
  tidy_dagitty(layout='circle') %>%
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link() +
  geom_dag_text(mapping = aes(label = label), colour = 'black') +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_adjusted()
```

## Example: Before and After

dagify(hate_crime ~ rally + unchanging + changing,
      rally ~ unchanging + changing,
       exposure = "rally",

       labels = c('rally' = "(X) Trump\nRally", 
                  'hate_crime' = "(Y) Hate Crimes",

                  'unchanging' = 'Unchanging\nAttributes'
                  )) %>%

  #geom_dag_node() +
  geom_dag_edges_link(mapping = aes(label = c("","","","", "held constant\n(link broken)", "held constant\n(link broken)")),  
                                    angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(c(1,-1,1,-1,-1),'lines'),
                                    edge_linetype = rep(c(1,1,1,2,2), each = 100),
                                    arrow = grid::arrow(length=grid::unit(c(10,10,10,0,0,0), 'pt'), type = 'closed')) +

  scale_adjusted()
```

## Example: Before and After

### **Confounding Solved?**...

**All** confounding variables (affect whether a rally occurs; affect hate crimes) that are **unchanging over time** are held constant.

- because held constant, cannot produce confounding
- e.g., demographic features, political leaning, location/geography, long-term economic trends, 8chan white nationalists
- any variable that **does not change *in the time period of the comparison* ** (in this case, two months) held constant
- does not matter if we can think of or even measure the confounders


## Design Based Solutions

**Before and after** comparisons are **design based**, because...

- they hold constant ALL **unchanging** confounding variables (a **class** of confounding variables).
- contrast to conditioning, only blocks specific variables/paths

And like all solutions to confounding: they make an **assumption**

## Design Based Solutions

Just like experiments and confounding, **Before and After** comparisons plug in for MISSING potential outcomes.

| County | Time   |  $Y:$ HC(Yes) | $Y:$ HC(No) | $X:$ Rally |
|--------|--------|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|
| $c$      | Before | $\color{red}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{Rally}]}$    | $\color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{No Rally}]}$  | No    |
|        |        |         |   $\Downarrow$     |       |
| $c$    | After  | $\color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,After}[\text{Rally}]}$    |  $\color{red}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,After}[\text{No Rally}]}$ | Yes   |

## Design Based Solutions

| County | Time   |  $Y:$ HC(Yes) | $Y:$ HC(No) | $X:$ Rally |
|--------|--------|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|
| $c$    | Before | $\color{red}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{Rally}]}$    | $\color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{No Rally}]}$  | No    |
|        |        |         |   $\Downarrow$     |       |
| $c$    | After  | $\color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,After}[\text{Rally}]}$    |  $\boxed{\color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{No Rally}]}}$ | Yes   |

We **assume** $\color{red}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,After}[\text{No Rally}]} = \\ \color{black}{\text{Hate Crimes}_{c,Before}[\text{No Rally}]}$

That is: if $X$ had not changed, $Y$ would not have changed.

## Before and After 

### Assumptions:

- assume that counterfactual potential outcomes of $Y$ without $X$ **after** $X$ happens, same as factual $Y$ without $X$ **before** $X$ happens
- equivalently: assume there are no variables $W$ that affect $Y$ and *change over time* with $X$.

Any $W$ that affects $Y$ and changes with $X$ will produce confounding **even if it does not *cause*** $X$.

- this is a *new* problem

## Example: Before and After

### **When does this assumption fail?**

- Did Trump rallies take place in places that are already **trending** toward having more hate crimes?
- Is it possible that Trump wanted to avoid controversy and waited to hold rallies in places until they had a month with a lower-than-usual number of hate crimes? (board)

>- We can address these concerns by looking at longer-term trends...

```

Mostly constant upward trend; no change when rallies occur

## Example: Before and After

### **When does this assumption fail?**

**Over-time comparison**, we can **create** confounding from variables that do not **cause** $X$ to change, if they also **change with** $X$ over time...

- Does rally change **measurement**, but not **actual number** of hate crimes? (Measurement bias)

    - we can examine this concern by measuring hate crimes in other ways.
    
- Are there are other changes over the same time-frame (change at the same time as $X$, rallies)?

    - This is harder to solve. In the same situation as conditioning.
    - Less of a problem when comparing across very short time periods (fewer variables change)

## Example: Before and After

It may be that the effects are due to changes in **measurement**: Anti-Defamation League vs. FBI Hate Crimes give different results.

## Another Example:

<img src="./acemoglu_1.png" width = 90%>

Why have real wages stayed stagnant?

## Another Example:

<img src="./acemoglu_2.png" width = 80%>

Starting in the 1980s, automation via robotics/software started to grow.

## Another Example:

From "before" to "after" growth of automation, we see slowing or even reversal of growth in real wages:

- automation $\to$ inequality, worse job / health outcomes

<img src="https://www.sify.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/luddites_youtube.jpg" width=90%>

Can we reasonably conclude the machines are to blame?

## Design: Before and After

### What is it?

Compare the same case to itself **before and after** change in $X$

### How does it work?

Holds constant all **unchanging attributes** of the case.

- any confounding variables that do not change over time cannot produce change in $Y$ with change in $X$


## Before and After: Assumptions

In order to infer $X$ causes $Y$ if $X,Y$ correlated in before/after comparison

### **Must Assume**

1. There are **no other variables** that affect $Y$ and *change* with $X$ over time (may be a causal or non-causal link of $W$ and $X$)

##  Before and After: Limitations

This assumption can be violated if...

- other variables that affect $Y$ change with $X$ over time.
- Value of $Y$ in cases has a long-term trend in one direction
- $X$ changes **in response** to extreme changes in $Y$ (e.g. gun laws respond to uptick in gun crimes)
- $X$ changes **measurement** of $Y$
