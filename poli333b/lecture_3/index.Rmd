### What defines/ what are key attributes of "race" or "ethnicity"

# To the Board

## Essentialist definition

### **essentialist definition of race/ethnicity**:

an identity where membership...

- is based on descent
- is inherited at birth
- is an immutable/unchangeable part of who a person is
- is to a group who share some essential similarity
- is to a group that has persisted through time

Thus:

- natural ("blood", "genes")
- shared culture (language, religion), tradition, history

## Essentialist definition

**"based on descent"** and **"inherited at birth"**

Gil-White (1999) interviewed Mongolians, majority of whom claimed that people born to mixed Mongolian/Kazakh parents were Kazakh, regardless of their cultural upbringing.

## Essentialist definition

**essential similarity** and **persistent**

> Each nation harbors the dream that its borders will revert to those it boasted when the ancient empire it once possessed was at the zenith of expansion. Because Philip II of Macedon, a monarch with strong Greek ties, established de facto rule over much of present-day Greece in the fourth century B.C., *the Greeks believe* Macedonia to be theirs. Because the Bulgarians in the tenth century, under King Simeon and later King Samuel, and again in the thirteenth century, under King Ivan Assen II, extended the frontiers of Bulgaria all the way west to the Adriatic Sea, *the Bulgarians believe* Macedonia to be theirs. Because the Serbian King Stefan Dušan overran Macedonia in the fourteenth century, and was crowned Emperor and Autocrat of the Serbs and the Byzantines, the Bulgars and the Albanians, in the Macedonian city of Skopje, *the Serbs believe* Macedonia to be theirs. - Robert Kaplan

## Key questions: {.build}

### How does Ava Duvernay's family history complicate the essentialist definition?

### Why does it matter to her that her ancestry is >50% African?

## Rejecting Essentialism

### Checkered history

- White supremacy, slavery, eugenics, genocide

- anti-colonial struggles for self determination

## Rejecting Essentialism:

Brubaker and Cooper (2000):

**categories of practice**: categories/concepts of everyday life, used by social and political actors

**categories of analysis**: categories/concepts employed by social scientists attempting to describe and explain phenomena in society


## Rejecting Essentialism:

Essentialist definition of ethnicity/race is a **category of practice**; 

but it fails as a **category of analysis**.

- **today** no serious academic research employs essentialist understanding of ethnicity
- but, there these categories were **reified** in the past

## Rejecting Essentialism

Moving toward "primordialism"

> "The attachment to another member of one’s kinship group is not just a function of interaction... It is because a certain ineffable signicance **is attributed** to the tie of blood"

the psychological attachment to descent-based membership is **innate** in humans (Gil-White 1999)

---

### **primordialist definition of race/ethnicity**:

an identity where membership is based on **perceived** descent such that it is 

- inherited at birth
- even if not in fact, people **believe** that it:
    - is an immutable/unchangeable part of who a person is
    - a group in which all share some essential similarity
    - a group which shares a history and interests


Thus, ethnicity/race:

- durable/hard to change once created; changes are slow
- shared (or imagination of shared) culture (language, religion), tradition, history
- even if not natural, people treat them "as if" they are natural

## Primordialism vs Essentialism:

Primordialist definition of ethnicity differs from essentialism:

- It does not accept essentialist definition of ethnicity, but states that most people in practice adopt an essentialist view of ethnicity.
