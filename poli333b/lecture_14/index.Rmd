## South Asia: Communal Violence

Hindu-Muslim divide a continuing source of conflict, violence

- Major political parties divided on the issue
- Major riots in Delhi, 2020.
- Conflict over Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens

## South Asia: Before Colonization

**Hindus**

- no unifying label was in widespread use
- texts, rituals, traditions highly varied
- disputes within "Hindus"

**Muslims**

- often labeled by their geographic origin, not by religion

**Syncretism**

- Hindus and Muslims shared saints, holy men, shrines, gods, festivals
- religious practices/taboos spread across the divide
- cross-cultural hybrid identities

## South Asia: Before Colonization

In this period...

- Muslim rulers broadly tolerant of different religious practices
- Hindu-Muslim violence rare; often not understood as about religion at the time

### **How did the Hindu-Muslim cleavage emerge?**

## South Asia: Colonization

One part of the story is the British Colonial Census of India

- First taken in 1871
- Recognized only the religious categories of: "Hindu", "Muslim", "Sikh", and "Christian" (later more added).
- Defined rules for applying these labels to colonial subjects
- Created basis for institutions to recognize and differentiate between people using these categories

## South Asia: Colonization

### Census and Structure:

British colonial imagination imposed on diverse population:

> "'Hindu' means a non-Musalman native of India."

> "a quarter of the persons classed as Hindus denied the supremacy of the brahmans and the authority of the Vedas; more than half did not receive the mantras from a recognised Hindu guru, a quarter did not worship the great Hindu gods, and were not served by good Brahmans priests; a third were denied access to temple; a quarter caused pollution by touch, a seventh always buried their dead, while a half did not regard cremation as obligatory and two-fifths ate beef."

Lieberman and Singh (2017), p. 41

## South Asia: Colonization

### Census and Structure:

Census categories...

- were **institutional use**
- became basis of **institutional separation**
- produced reports on size, geography, economic/political status of "groups" (**groupness**)
- created new knowledge about **power disparity**

## South Asia: Colonization

**Census and Psychology:**

- Social Identity Theory: people seek to maintain or promote their group status
- fear of reduced majority/permanent minority status $\to$ ethnic mobilization

When census showed smaller Hindu majority$^*$

- Hindu elites used census data to argue Hindus "a dying race" in their homeland

- Hindu political organizations:  reassert Hindu "traditions", purge hybrid religion, enforce "purity"

- Muslim elites feared status compared to new "Hindu" majority: lobbied to split up Hindu census category


## South Asia: Colonization

### Strategic Response

Ethnic "entrepreneurs" exploit the census to make political gains

- Muslim elites use Census data to lobby for special protections, institutions (separate electorates)
- BJP (Hindu political party) used 2011 census data to attack rival secular parties for ignoring growth rate of Muslims vs. Hindus

# Census and Conflict

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

Building on these insights:

Does including more ethnic dimensions on the census induce greater ethnic conflict?

- **structurally**: possible to *imagine* groups, *see* economic/political disparities, be recognized by the state
- **psychologically**: invites inter-group comparison, efforts to maintain/change relative group status
- **strategically**: creates opportunities for ethnic entrepreneuers

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

### Data:

**Census**

- tracked down 1333 census questionnaires for 156 countries between 1800 and 2005, nearly all of modern censuses

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

### Data

- "Politically Relevant Ethnic Groups": expert coding of ethnic groups that are politically "activated"
- Ethnic Violence: ranging from riots to armed conflict
- Ethnic Civil War: armed conflicts coded as "Ethnic"

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

Countries with more ethnic cleavages enumerated in the census, compated to those with fewer, have...

- **more** politically relevant ethnic groups
- **more** ethnic violence
- **more** ethnic armed conflicts

## Lieberman and Singh (2017) {.centered}

<img src='./ls_1.png' width = 40%>

>- Are you convinced that census enumeration of ethnicity **causes** ethnic conflict? Why or why not?

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

Other differences, related to census, may actually cause conflict:

- heterogeneity of descent based attributes
- colonial legacy
- democratic vs autocratic institutions

>- **confounding**

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

**Conditioning**:

Comparing countries that **differ in ethnic census** but **similar**$^*$ in:

- GDP per capita, population, colonial ruler, regime type, political exclusion of ethnic groups, oil production, terrain, year, time since independence

...nevertheless, find **census use of ethnic categories** $\xrightarrow{increases}$ conflict

$^*$ using mathematical approximation

## Lieberman and Singh (2017)

**Placebo**:

If prior ethnic conflict $\to$ enumerating more ethnic groups, then cannot conclude census $\xrightarrow{causes}$ conflict.

Does census enumeration of ethnic groups **predict earlier ethnic conflict**?

>- It does not! This is reassuring, but not definitive.

## Conclusion:

Takeaways:

- understanding how Hindu/Muslim divide emerged
- understanding importance of censuses

Make use of all three perspectives on ethnicity:

- **structural**, **psychological**, **strategic**
- complementary, **not** either/ot
