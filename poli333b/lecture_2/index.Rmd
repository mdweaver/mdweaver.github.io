### My Approach

- Histor#### Methods

ical cases
- Rigorous statistical analysis
- "Big data"

- How is#### Questions

 violence used to produce ethnicity/race?
- How is media/discourse used to enable/stop violence?
- What are the political consequences of violence?

# Course Learning Objectives

## Learning Objectives: Academic

- What is ethnicity/race? 
- Where do ethnic/racial groups come from?
- Why ethnic conflict? Is it different than other political conflicts, and why?
- Why does ethnic violence occur?

# Course Expectations

## Your grade

| Item             | Number | Fraction of Grade |
|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Reading Responses | 10      | (10*2.5) 25%        |
| Short Papers | 3      | (3*15) 45%        |
| Final Assignment | 1      | 30%               |

## Reading Responses:

- Graded for effort: 100 you tried;, 71 if it shows minimal effort, 0 if nothing.
- Best 7 out of 10

## Grading: Papers

### $\bullet$ **One TA**

# Course Policies

### **Grades can change $\Updownarrow$**


## Public Health

- Masks required, but concessions are possible
- Please don't come if you feel ill; I will follow same protocol
- Sharing notes, easy concessions/forgiving lateness policies.
- Asynchronous/online a possibility, but not preferred.

## Sensitive Material

- A sort of "trigger" warning

## Don't be "that guy"
