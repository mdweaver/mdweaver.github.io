# Ethnicity and Structure

## Outline

- Ethnic boundaries as structures
- Changing Ethnic Boundaries

# Ethnic Boundaries

# Structure vs Individuals

## Ethnic Boundaries

- **multitude of ways** of ethnicity to be used in practice
- boundaries may or may not reflect intentional/conscious discrimination
- boundaries may or may not be detrimental to people on either side
- consequences of increasing/decreasing one boundary practice likely to be different from another.
    - some more relevant to strategic choice vs psychological response

## Ethnic Boundaries

useful to think of **ethnic boundaries** as **structures** 

- durable and reproduced over time
- order and constrain individual choices/actions
- but not **essential**... boundary practices vary across context and change over time

They are often durable because:

- categories/ways of thinking about ethnicity shape material world
- material reality can reinforce categories/ways of thinking

## Ethnic Boundaries

### Example: Race and Criminality

- Portrayals of African Americans as criminal informs police behavior/crime policy (ideas $\to$ material behavior)
    - media portrayals 
- Police behavior shapes what we "know" about crime (behavior $\to$ ideas)
    - informs crime statistics; media portrayals
    
## Ethnic Boundaries

But: there is a tension between ethnic **boundaries** and ethnic **identification** (Wimmer)

we can resolve the paradox: social boundaries are **intersubjective**

- $S_2O$: two subjects (people), one object (material world)
- mutual intelligibility and shared understanding of material world
- people understand the categories, rules for membership, and how they are used, even if they DO NOT CONSENT/AGREE WITH these practices.

- boundaries **made up of** and **reproduced by** individual interactions


## Ethnic Boundaries

Because boundaries are made of individual actions, they are changeable

But because they involve understanding and coordination between many people, hard to change (not the same as **slow to change**)

## Causes of Boundary Change

1. Encounter: new contact can generate new line (e.g. immigrants)
2. Imposition: state/powerful actor uses categories in new way
3. Borrowing: transposing boundary practices into a new domain
4. Conversation: ordinary interactions
5. Incentive shift: strategic behavior


## Examples:

- OJ?
- George Floyd and Police Brutality?
