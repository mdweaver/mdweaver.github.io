## Outline

- Media and Violence
  - Coordinaton
  - Persuasion
- Evidence

# Media and Violence:

## A Puzzle:

Electoral Logic:

- Why do voters follow ethnic parties after violence? Why not ostracize party for fomenting violence?

Power consolidation:

- Why frame the violence as just? Why extensive newspaper editorializing?
- Why is this perceived as "legitimate"?

### What is the role of media and messaging in ethnic violence?

---

How does media "incite violence"?

## Media and Violence 

### Coordination

### Persuasion

These shape the motives, opportunities, and cost of doing violence

## Media and Violence

### **Persuasion**

Framing of events might change how people perceive/what people believe...

- what "problems" are there in society (what moral transgressions have occurred? what moral order ought be imposed?) **diagnostic frames**
- what are the "solutions" to this problem? **prognostic frames**
- what are the "facts" of what has happened? (what frames are credible?)

## Media and Violence

### **Coordination**

Transaction costs of organizing violence

- How to coordinate collective violence
- How to acquire information/weapons/targets

Consequences of violence

- Social pressure (within social network) to not/do violence
- Supportive voices offsets risk of condemnation


# Example


## Rwandan Genocide: Background

- Colonial Origins of Hutu/Tutsi divide
- Independence created political struggle
- Civil War in 1980s, Tutsi armed group
- Breakdown of peace process in 1993-4

## Yanagizawa-Drott (2014)

### RTLM

- Government-run radio station

### Framing

**Diagnostic frames**:

- Emphasized RPF (Tutsi armed group) atrocities
- Alleged local Tutsis involved in conspiracy to dominate Hutus
- Dehumanized Tutsis as "cockroaches"

**Prognostic frames**:

- Preemptive violence necessary for "self-defense"

## Rwandan Genocide: Question

### Did radio endorsement of violence cause violence?

### Was it persuasion? Coordination?

## Rwandan Genocide: Question

**Some intuitions**:

### Persuasion

Violence perpetrated by **individuals** could be **coordination** or **persuasion**

### Coordination

Violence perpetrated **collectively** likely **coordination**

Exponential effects suggest **coordination** rather than **persuasion**

"Spill-over"/"neighborhood" effects of radio suggest **coordination**

## Rwandan Genocide: Difficulty

### Selection Effects

Radio transmitters built by government... 

- built in places with disposition toward violence?
- built in places with greater government/party control?

## Rwandan Genocide

### "Random Variation" in Radio Exposure

Neighboring villages that are...

- same distance to radio transmitter
- but radio signals arbitrarily disrupted by local terrain

## Rwanda: Effects of Radio (RTLM)

Moderate increase in individual violence

**could be coordination**

* government endorsement of violence reduces costs for individuals
  
**could be persuasion**

* convinced of Tutsi threat
* believe dehumanization

## Rwanda: Effects of Radio (RTLM)

### Evidence of **Coordination** if we Would observe...

**Increase in collective violence at high radio exposure**

- moving from sporadic to coordinated violence
- increases could be non-linear (exponential)

**Radio exposure in neighboring villages *amplifies*, not *offsets* violence**

- persuasion if nearby radio exposure **offsets** local radio effects on violence (radio exposure in neighboring village has no effect if there is radio in the village)

- coordination if nearby radio exposure **amplifies** local radio effects (neighboring village radio exposure increases collective violence)

## Conclusion

- Persuasion vs Coordination effects of media
- Evidence of coordination via media
- Does p
