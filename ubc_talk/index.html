> "**I led the mob** which lynched Nelse Patton and **I'm proud of it**. ... I
directed every movement of the mob. **I wanted him lynched**. I saw his body
dangling from a tree this morning, and I am glad of it. **I aroused the mob and
directed them to storm the jail**. I had my revolver but did not use it. I gave it to a deputy sheriff and **told him to shoot** Patton and shoot to kill."

##The argument

---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
]


.right-column[
### Most Violence is "Moral"

  * Perpetrators believe they are in the right (Black 1983, Fiske and Rai 2014)
  * **Cultural context** determines reception (e.g. who is a criminal)
  
### Which violence gets to be "legitimate" in a context?
]


---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
]


.right-column[
### Which violence is "legitimate"?

* Can't simply aggregate local preferences, assume homogeneous culture
* Preference falsification (Wedeen 1998, Scott 1990), *whose* preferences? (Pitkin 1972)

### Which violence is "*legitimated*"?

* Public acts that explicitly/implicitly justify violence
* Like diagnostic, prognostic framing
* Does not presume belief
* Can be contested 

]


---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
]


.right-column[
### Which violence is "legitimated"?

#### Motive

- Perpetrators (and people who value relationships with them)
- Victims and potential victims (and people who value relationships with them)

#### Opportunity

Powerful people have

- Means to frame 
    - Determine "facts", diagnostic framing
    - Enforse violence as solution, prognostic framing
    - Influence over local media, cultural institutions
- Means to deny framing to others (coercion to silence critics)
]



---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
]


.right-column[
### When powerful actors are perpetrators:

1. Violence is publicly legitimated
2. Difficult to challenge because of reputational costs, risk of coercion
3. May be self-reinforcing dynamic
  - Determine both "facts" and norms

### How can this dynamic be challenged?

##Publicity Shocks

---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
### Publicity
]


.right-column[
### Reach
  * Geographic scope of audience
  * May not share local norms on violence .red.bold[*]
  * Critics not silenced

### Inclusivity
  * Inclusion of different voices in public debate
  * Victims and allies no longer silent .red.bold[*]
  * 'Facts' and justifications around violence contested 
  * Usually builds on "reach"


.footnote[.red.bold[*] See, e.g. Keck and Sikkink 1998]
]


---

.left-column[
##Argument
### Violence
### Publicity
]


.right-column[
### Under some conditions...

1. News of violence reaches new audience
2. New audience is interested
3. New audience is critical/persuaded by victims
4. News of criticism reaches locality
5. Locals value relationship/reputation with audience

### ... increasing publicity can

1. Challenge hegemony of pro-violence discourses locally
2. Increase reputational costs to endorse or tacitly approve violence
3. Increase costs of permitting violence to occur

.left-column[
##Argument

### Publicity

.right-column[
### How do changes in publicity occur?

#### In part, broad social, economic, political transformations

#### In part, technological change

Communication technologies can either 

- **produce** conditions for greater publicity 
- or **modulate access** to publicity
