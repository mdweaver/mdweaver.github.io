I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. 
My am interested in the politics of violence. 
In particular, I study the legitimation of state and non-state violence as well as the causes and consequences of ethnic violence.

My dissertation, "Publicity and the Delegitimation of Lynching" addresses the question of how violence becomes publicly unacceptable by examining why public support for lynching rapidly gave way to outrage and opprobrium around the turn of the 20th century. I argue that the expansion of communication networks produced by railroad and telegraph thrust news about lynching onto a national stage. In the process, more critical narratives of lynching emerged and reached audiences who did not share in the local justifications of lynching. At the same time, this national publicity provided activists the opportunity to give voice to African American narratives of lynching, challenging the justifications provided by lynching apologists. To test this argument I have compiled novel historical big data on lynching coverage in more than 8 million newspaper issues between 1880 and 1940 as well as data on the expansion of railroad lines across the United States.
