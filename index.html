<h1>About</h1>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8139153/flannel.jpg" height="300" style="float:right">I am a graduate student in Political Science at Yale University. 
My research focuses on the politics of violence. In particular, I study contestation over the legitimacy of violence as well as the causes and consequences of ethnic violence.</p>
