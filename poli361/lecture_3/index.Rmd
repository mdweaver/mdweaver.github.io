# STOP

## Think and Write

### 2-3 minutes:

### According to "common sense":

### What are definitions/key attributes of "race" or an "ethnic group"

#

## Essentialist definition

### **essentialist definition of race/ethnicity**:

an identity where membership is based on descent and is

- inherited at birth
- fixed (unchangable for individuals, and unchanging over time)
- universal (all group members share traits, capacities, competences, behaviors)

Thus:

- natural ("blood", "genes")
- shared culture (language, religion), tradition, history

## Key questions:

### - Why does it matter she is more than 50%?
  
### - How does her fatherâ€™s family history relate to the received history of African Americans?

### **primordialist definition of race/ethnicity**:

an identity where membership is based on descent and is

- inherited at birth
- even though not in fact, **people think** of it as:

    - fixed (unchangable for individuals, and unchanging over time)
    - universal (group members share traits, capacities, competences, behaviors)
    - natural ("blood", "genes")

Thus, ethnicity/race:

- durable/hard to change once created
- shared (or imagination of shared) culture (language, religion), tradition, history
- even if not natural, act "as if" they are natural
