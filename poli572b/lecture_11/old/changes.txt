- review regression properties


- conditioning
	- what does it assume?
	- what does it do?
	
	
- regression:
	- conditioning is a conditional expectation function
	- regression is also a way of estimating conditional expectation function
	- it is linear and additive in its terms... 
	- imputation...
	- what is the basic idea of imputation: regression plugs in best guess of what missing potential outcome SHOULD be based on linear and additive model specification ... movement in linearly orthogonal segments of the data 
	- assumptions:
		- conditional independence (strong ignorability)-
		- positivity
		- considerations: regression CIA  hinges on linearity and additivity: are effects linear? are effects the same for different subgroups? when imputing, do values of potential outcomes of Y vary in interacting ways.
		- considerations: positivity => not the average causal effect
		- considerations: weights => what is the causal estimand?
	- what does conditional independence mean in the case of regression? 
		- linear dependence removed, but non-linear dependence persists... 
			- EXAMPLE using effect of hours on earnings
		- imputation EXERCISE: peacekeeping data... effects of peacekeeping, conditional on...
			- take data, calculate the missing potential outcomes: 
				- regress y on x
				- create counterfactual data: copy data, change peacekeeping label
				- generate predicted outcomes using counterfactual data
				- create y1
				- create y0
				- calculate tau_i
				- take average
				- compare with regression coefficient
			- calculate average effect
		- omitted variable bias: what is magnitude of bias if we fail to condition on something...
	- what is the role of linearity/additivity: interpolation bias: regression can generate biases due to functional form assumptions ...
		- lack of cases that are identical...
		- imputation...
		- this can lead to bias if imputation is wrong
		- we can relax linearity: polynomials, relax additivity: interactions:
			- example of earnings
	- what is the role of positivity?:
		- extrapolation bias: rather than putting 0 weight on strata without variation in treatment, will impute what expected treatment is...
		- extrapolation may lead to model dependence: where there is no data (untrated or treated) regression extrapolates an answer...
		- activity
		- weighting... should put 0 weight where there is no variance in treatment... but regression weights cases by variance in treatment conditional on x...
			- in essence putting more weight on cases where residual D is farther from 0.
			- may no longer correspond to your sample of interest
			- may place extreme weight on some cases
			
			- weights on cases... not necessarily a BAD thing
			- weights on levels of treatment... average causal response function... may put more weight on some parts of this function than others.
			- weights are harder to describe when we permit many continuous variables.
			
			- but there are conditions where... no interpolation bias, no extrapolation, known weighting scheme.
