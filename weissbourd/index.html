  ## Discourses
  ### Pro-
]

.right-column[

###Arguments in favor
* Inefficiency/corruption of justice system
* Popular sovereignty
* Law does not deter criminals
* Threat of black criminality/sexuality
* 'Natural' response to rape

  ## Discourses
  ### Pro-
]

.right-column[

###Justificatory Narratives

* Protagonists
  * Sober, rational, all/leading citizens of town
  * Passive voice: no individuals did the lynching
  * Lynching was natural/unavoidable response
* Antagonists
  * Black men dehumanized: "savages", "brutes", "beasts"
  * Assumed to be guilty
  * By default shown as sexually aggressive, criminals
* Lynched *because* guilty

]

.left-column[
  ## Discourses
  ### Pro-
  ### Anti-
]

.right-column[

###Arguments

Refuted pro-lynching claims

* e.g. rape alleged in minority of cases
* Lynching a threat to law and order
* Lynching part of a system of racial violence
  * e.g. Du Bois: "The police is the mob. The courts are the lynchers."

###Narratives
  Black voices counter white narratives about lynching
  * NAACP investigations
  * Ida Wells publications
  * Scottsboro Trials

  ### Measure
]

.right-column[

### Measurement

* Keywords and phrases corresponding to pro- and anti-lynching rhetoric
* Appearance of keywords in articles
* Scaled:

`$$scaled_j =  \left( \frac{1}{n_d} \sum_{i=1}^{n_d} discourseWord_i \right) - \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Word_i \right)$$`

- Scaling accounts for relative frequency of discourse keywords compared to relative frequency of all words.
- Take difference between anti- and pro- lynching discourse.

  ## Limitations
]

### Discourse

* Which anti-lynching discourses won out?
* Where did they emerge?
* How were coded defenses of lynching used?
* Did white newspapers adopt language from activists?

### Keywords are too blunt to answer these questions

.right-column[

### New data

Full text versus keyword searches

* 3 archives (ChroniclingAmerica, Newspapers.com, NewspaperArchive)
* 16 million issues between 1870 and 1940.
* 9 million issues, 70 million pages obtained so far

* LDA, LSI, SVM, etc.
* Tools create 'bag of words' for each document
* Supervised, unsupervised classification of documents, based on co-occurrence of words.

Nice properties:

* Man : King :: Woman : ? => Queen

Importantly:

* Spelling variations appear as similar in vector space:
* Uses only nearby words (computationally easy)

Happy to discuss specifics (and suggestions) in Q & A

1. **What should be "cleaned"?** e.g. remove punctuation? stop words? words not in dictionary?

2. **Which model?** and which parameter settings?

3. **How to aggregate scores to documents?** 

	* mean? weighted mean? other?

4. **Which classifier??**
	
	* How many categories?
	* How many trained examples?
