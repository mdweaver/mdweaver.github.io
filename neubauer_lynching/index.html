> "**I led the mob** which lynched Nelse Patton and **I'm proud of it**. ... I
directed every movement of the mob. **I wanted him lynched**. I saw his body
dangling from a tree this morning, and I am glad of it. **I aroused the mob and
directed them to storm the jail**. I had my revolver but did not use it. I gave it to a deputy sheriff and **told him to shoot** Patton and shoot to kill."
